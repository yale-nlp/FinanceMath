The variables are defined as follows: `P(A)` is the probability of insolvency, `P(B)` is the probability of a \"good\" rating, and `P(B | A)` is the probability of a \"good\" rating given insolvency. The program calculates the numerator and denominator of Bayes' theorem and returns the result, which is the probability of insolvency given a \"good\" rating."

        "question": "Sam, a market analyst at an investment bank, is conducting research on companies operating in the housing market sector. The leading company in this sector, named LoveYourHome, has recently released its annual financial report, revealing a basic EPS of $56, and a diluted EPS of $52. After examining the footnotes in LoveYourHome's financial report, Sam identifies a nonrecurring profit of $2 per share and a one-time restructuring cost of $3 per share, stemming from an acquisition in the previous year. Utilising a top-down analysis approach, Sam projects that LoveYourHome's basic EPS will rise to 76 in the upcoming year. The company's current share price is $72. Sam is keen to assess the relative worth within the housing sector using the trailing P/E ratio. Given the information provided, what is LoveYourHome's trailing Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio?",

            "Here's the Python program to calculate the depreciation expense for the first year under IFRS and US GAAP:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    total_cost = 1000000\n    part_a_cost = 500000\n    part_b_cost = 500000\n    part_a_life = 10\n    part_b_life = 5\n    \n    # Calculate depreciation expense under IFRS\n    ifrs_depreciation = total_cost / 10\n    \n    # Calculate depreciation expense under US GAAP\n    us_gaap_depreciation = (part_a_cost / part_a_life) + (part_b_cost / part_b_life)\n    \n    # Calculate the difference\n    difference = us_gaap_depreciation - ifrs_depreciation\n    \n    # return answer\n    return difference\n```\n\nThis program first calculates the total depreciation expense under IFRS, which is the total cost of the machine divided by its useful life of 10 years. Then, it calculates the depreciation expense under US GAAP, which is the sum of the depreciation expenses of each part, calculated as the cost of each part divided by its useful life. Finally, it returns the difference between the US GAAP depreciation expense and the IFRS depreciation expense."
