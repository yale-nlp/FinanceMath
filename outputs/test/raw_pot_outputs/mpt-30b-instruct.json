They are assessing the financial records of Corporation ABC (ABC), focusing on post-employment rewards. Stevens modifies the balance sheet and cash flow statement details presented in Exhibit 2 to more accurately represent the financial aspect of certain pension plan related items. Finally, Stevens scrutinizes the details present in Exhibit 3 and determines the effect of a 100-basis-point hike in health care inflation on ABC's debt-to-equity ratio. Considering Exhibits 2 and 3, alongside Boone's projection about future health care inflation, what should the debt-to-equity ratio computed by Stevens for ABC be?",

In each period, the share price has a 40% chance to increase by $1.2 and a 60% chance to decrease by $0.8. We can then use the following formula:\n\nThe number of paths to $x$ after $n$ steps is: ${{n}\\choose{x}}\\cdot p^x\\cdot(1-p)^{n-x}$\n\nWe then get the number of paths to $101.2$ after 2 steps by setting $x=2$ and solve for: $S_x={{2}\\choose{2}}\\cdot(0.4)^2\\cdot(0.6)^0=0.16$ ($x$ is reached after two increases)\n\nIn a similar fashion, we solve for $S_d={{2}\\choose{0}}\\cdot(0.6)^2\\cdot(0.4)^0=0.24$ ($x$ is reached after two decreases)\n\nWe multiply these probabilities to get the total number of paths to 101.2 after two steps: $S_x+S_d=0.16+0.24=0.4$\n\nThus, the overall probability is: $365\\div(2\\cdot101.2)=101.2\\div(0.4\\cdot101.2)=\\boxed{253\\text{ out of 365}}$, using the crude approximation."

PFMA was created to fund a range of medical research endeavors. Fatimah is thrilled and requests Jordan to work out the return objective of PFMA's portfolio. Kyoto points out the following:• PFMA’s main investment goal is to preserve the real purchasing power of its portfolio after distributions.• The risk-free rate is 4.0%.• An expected inflation rate is 3.5%.• The portfolio’s standard deviation is 15.0%.• The cost of earning investment returns is 50 bp.• PFMA aims for a 5.5% annual distribution of assets. What is PFMA’s return objective? (2020 mock PM)",

We denote the length of a bond as $T$ period and the cash flow frequency (number of periods per year) as $n$. This implies that $T$ is divisible by $n$ and yields $m$ periods. Therefore, the effective annual yield of a bond with semiannual payments is given by $r = \\dfrac{2}{T \\cdot n}$. The number of periods to maturity then equals $m = T / (2 \\cdot n)$.\n\nIf we discount a bond's cash flows by an effective annual rate of $r$, we have: $f_0\\, (1 + r)^{n T / 2} = f_T$.

After examining the footnotes in LoveYourHome's financial report, Sam identifies a nonrecurring profit of $2 per share and a one-time restructuring cost of $3 per share, stemming from an acquisition in the previous year. Utilising a top-down analysis approach, Sam projects that LoveYourHome's basic EPS will rise to 76 in the upcoming year. The company's current share price is $72.

We see that 5 is an outcome in the range of values for 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 values, and 10 is an outcome in the range of values for 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 values.  Additionally, 10 is also an outcome for 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 values and 16 is an outcome for 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 values.  None of the other values in the distribution contain 20 as an outcome.  Solving for the total number of outcomes where 5 <= X < 10, we find 5 is accounted for in 5 <= X < 9 and 10 is accounted for in 5 <= X < 10, 9, and 11 <= X < 10, for a total of $5_5+10_{10}=16$ outcomes that satisfy this condition.

Accounts receivable fell by $56,000, so the average accounts receivable fell by $56,000 / receivables turnover.\n\nThe inventory increase of $20,000 means cost of goods sold increased by $20,000 / (1 - receivables turnover).\n\nThen the cash collections were revenue - cost of goods sold - change in accounts payable - change in accounts receivable, or $300,000 - ($20,000 * (1 - receivables turnover)) - $9,000 + ($56,000 / receivables turnover).\n\nSimplifying and multiplying by receivables turnover gives $300,000 - $140,000 - $9,000 + $56,000 = $101,000.
