The provided table has corporate bonds returns as 6.5% and inflation as 2.1%. To compute the real rate of return, we subtract the inflation rate from the corporate bonds return, which gives us 6.5% - 2.1% = 4.4%. The Python program calculates this value and returns the real rate of return for corporate bonds."

I will provide an explanation of the `solution()` function according to the question:\n\nIn this case, we are given the default rates of two firms. We need to find the likelihood of both firms defaulting if the defaults occur separately. To do this, we will calculate the joint probability of both firms defaulting.\n\n`default_rate_firm_x` represents the default rate of Firm X, which is 10%. `default_rate_firm_y` represents the default rate of Firm Y, which is 20%. We will multiply these probabilities to find the joint probability of both firms defaulting.\n\nThe `joint_probability` variable stores the result of this multiplication, which is the likelihood of both firms defaulting if the defaults occur separately. This value is then returned by the function as the solution."

First, we define the variable `eps_2007` to be the EPS value for 2007, which is given as $3.03.\n2. Next, we calculate the PE using the Historical Average EPS method and assign it to the variable `pe_using_eps_2007`, which is 19.06.\n3. We also calculate the PE using the Average ROE method and assign it to the variable `pe_avg_roe`, which is 17.97.\n4. Then, we calculate the difference in PE by subtracting `pe_using_eps_2007` from `pe_avg_roe` and assign it to the variable `difference_in_pe`.\n5. Finally, we return the difference in PE by calling the `return` statement.\n\nThis Python program will output the difference in PE, which is 1.11, as an answer.

            "|    |    |\n|----|----|\n| Name | Jane Lennon |\n| Occupation and Family Structure | She is the morning news anchor for a national broadcasting company, where she has worked for the past 20 years. She is 56 years of age, divorced, and the sole supporter of her two children, Everett, aged 18, and Marshall, aged 14. Marshall suffers from severe medical and developmental issues. |\n| Current and Expected Future Employment Income | She currently earns $1 million per year as a broadcaster. She plans on retiring in four years. With typical raises in her industry, she estimates that the present value of her pre-retirement income is $4.5 million. |\n| Financial Assets and Liabilities | She has an investment portfolio worth $8 million, which consists of 30% equities and the remainder in fixed-income securities. She also owns $1 million in shares of the broadcasting company she works for, but she is restricted from selling them for two more years. Her primary residence carries no mortgage and was recently valued at $2 million. She also owns a vacation property worth $3 million, with an outstanding mortgage of $1 million. Her defined-contribution pension plan has vested and is valued at $2.5 million. |\n| Aspirational Goals and Extended Liabilities | Everett is just beginning university and plans to pursue a medical degree. Lennon plans on paying for his entire education and living expenses as well as providing some assistance in funding his future practice. She believes that these goals will be covered with $1.5 million in present value terms. She has begun the process of setting up a special needs trust to provide lifetime benefits for Marshall that will not interfere with the government benefits that he is eligible to receive. It will be funded with $2 million within the year. She recently received an honorary doctorate from her alma mater and has started the process of endowing a chair in its communications department. She anticipates that the funding will be made available to the university in two years; it has a present value of $1.75 million. The present value of future consumption is estimated to be $9 million. |"

Keep in mind the guidelines and requirements mentioned earlier.\n\nYour program should compile and provide the correct output based on the provided code of the problem. The program should be a complete Python program that takes no input, contains the relevant definitions and calculations, and returns the solution as an integer.\n\nSolution(s) may include integer or floating-point numbers. If the answer is a number, record the number as an integer. If you must record the number as a floating-point number due to rounding, round to two decimal places.\n\nThe main function should be called `solution`.\n\nMake sure the solution is accurate and in the proper units. For integer answers, round to the nearest integer. For decimal answers, round to two decimal places. Round your answer to the same number of decimal places as the original value. In general, answers are rounded to two decimal places unless otherwise specified.\n\nYour code should be clear, concise, and well-organized, following Python best practices for code style and organization. Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain non-obvious sections of the code. Use meaningful variable and function names.
