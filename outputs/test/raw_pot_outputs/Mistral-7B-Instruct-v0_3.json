To get the Total Assets, I first calculated the EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) from the operating income (3.6), interest expense (assuming a tax_rate was provided), and tax expense. After that, I used the total_assets equation, which is `Total Assets = (Total Debt + Equity) / (1 - Tax_rate)`. The Tax_rate is assumed to have already been calculated from the taxable income and tax values provided in the income statement. I also included comments to better understand the steps."

The forward price for a one-year zero-coupon bond starting in one year tells us the present price of a two-year zero-coupon bond. Since a two-year bond is actually two one-year bonds, we can find the present cost (PV) by discounting the forward price by the annual spot rate r(2) for two years. r(2) can be found using the formula for the forward price: r(1)^2 - 1 = r(2), where r(1) is the annual spot rate r(1)."

The profit is the sum of the profit from the put option and the profit from the call option. The profit from each option is calculated based on whether the final share price is less than or greater than the respective strike price. If the final share price is less than the strike price for the put option, the profit is the difference between the strike price and the share price, plus the price of the put option. If the final share price is greater than the strike price for the call option, the profit is the difference between the final share price and the strike price, plus the price of the call option. If the final share price is less than the strike price for the put option or greater than the strike price for the call option, the profit for that option is 0. The total profit is the sum of the profits from both options."

This way, a negative duration indicates that an increase in interest rates will result in an increase in the present value of liabilities, whereas a positive duration indicates that a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in the present value of liabilities. In the provided table, the base rate is 7%, so we set the base present value as the middle value, and the diffusion rates represent the differences between the given interest rates and the base rate. The returned value will represent the effective duration of the liabilities of the pension fund."

The PE using the historical average EPS approach is obtained by dividing the share price by the average EPS for the years 2003 to 2006 (inclusive). The PE using the average ROE approach takes into account the average return on the stock market and average years for which the stock will be kept, and it calculates the average dividend yield based on the average ROE. The difference between the two PEs is then returned."

However, in practice, it's also possible to use the forward points to calculate the forward rate. The formula is:\n\nforward_rate = (1 + (three_month_points / 10000)) ^ (3 / 360) * mid_spot\n\nIt's an accurate representation of the forward rate when the compounding period is a multiple of 30 days. If the compounding period varies, you might need to adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nTo make the code more flexible, you can define separate functions for calculating mid-spot and forward rates to capture different compounding periods and market conventions."

However, the provided data does not explicitly show these values. To make an assumption about Capex, we can use the change in fixed assets, assuming that a significant portion of the change is a result of Capital Expenditures. For NWC, we can calculate it by subtracting total current liabilities from total current assets.\n\nNow, we will generate a Python program assuming a growth rate for Capex.

We're given the spot rate for USD/EUR, forward rate for EUR/AUD, and the forward premium in points.\n\n2. To find the spot rate for USD/AUD, we first need to find the spot rate for EUR/AUD with the given forward rate and forward premium.\n\n3. As we know that the forward rate is the expected spot rate at a future date, to remove the effect of the forward premium (which is a premium for exchanging currencies at a future date over the expected spot rate) we can use the formula:\n\n    Spot rate for EUR/AUD = Forward rate for EUR/AUD / (1 + (Forward premium / 100))\n\n4. Once we find the spot rate for EUR/AUD, we can calculate the spot rate for USD/AUD using the following formula:\n\n    Spot rate for USD/AUD = 1 / (Spot rate for EUR/AUD * Spot rate for USD/EUR)\n\n5. This program calculates the spot rate for USD/AUD using the given data."

This Python program calculates the effective duration of a bond given the information provided in the question. It assumes that the price sensitivity follows the formula: (change in price / change in yield) * 365, where the change in yield is the result of a change in interest rates by 0.25%. The effective duration is then the average of the price sensitivities for an increase and a decrease in interest rates."

Calculating the answer by hand:\n\n```\nDebt-to-capital ratio = Total long-term debt / (Total long-term debt + Total equity)\n                           = (3800 + 5590 + 800) / (3800 + 5590 + 800 + 1200 + 1810)\n                           = 10190 / 12800\n                           ≈ 0.79375\n\nSo, the debt-to-capital ratio is approximately 79.375%\n```\n\nWhen implementing in the Python program, the user or the source of data would have to add short-term debt if available to get a more accurate calculation."

            " ```python\n    dividend_per_share = 500\n    growth_rate = 0.05\n    annual_growth_rate = growth_rate * 4\n    final_dividend = dividend_per_share * (1 + annual_growth_rate)**4\n    seller_price = 10000\n    necessary_return_rate = 0.15\n    dividend_yield = final_dividend / seller_price\n    present_value_of_dividend = final_dividend / (1 + necessary_return_rate)**4\n    present_value_of_seller_price = seller_price / (1 + necessary_return_rate)**4\n    inherent_value = present_value_of_dividend + present_value_of_seller_price - dividend_yield * seller_price\n\n    # return answer\n    return inherent_value\n```\n\nIn this example, the program calculates the inherent value of Travelpro's shares by first finding the final dividend after four years, then calculating the present value of the dividend and the present value of the seller price, and finally finding the inherent value by subtracting the present value of the dividend yield from the sum of the present values of the dividend and the seller price. The inherent value gives an estimate of the company's shares worth considering the given financial information and the necessary return rate for investors."
