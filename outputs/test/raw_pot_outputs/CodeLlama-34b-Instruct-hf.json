He designs a software program that applies bootstrap resampling to generate 200 resamples from this Saraswoti data through sampling with replacement. Each resample comprises of 108 data points. The software programmed by Perkins computes the average of each of the 200 resamples, then determines that the mean of these 200 resample means equals 0.0261. The program subtracts 0.0261 from each of the 200 resample means, squares each of these 200 differences, and totals up the squared differences, resulting in 0.835.

I realize that I need to practice more on Python to become a better programmer. I have joined r/learnpython and it helps a lot!\n- As the question suggest that useful function such as NumPy is used in the program. I need to look more into the documentation of NumPy and understand well-known concepts.\n- Before doing the question, I have to know about the calculation first, what does 3 * np.sqrt(27) mean? So, I read the explanation before looking at existing submission. I think, I become better at understanding the problem. I think what will achieve how to use Python will make me a good programmer.\n- The important thing is, the solution is to tell us that we must use or learn the key concepts first. After that, see the other person whose code is also different from the one in the problem, but they pass the test. After that, you will find out that there are many ways to attack the problem. Although there are many ways to solve this problem, I think I have to focus on the \"overall framework\" or structure of a solution."

There are two common options for financial investment in a new business, equity and debt, and the criteria will differ if these are to be used.\nFinancing through equity explains that a company is looking for your money, and that it will pay your investment back when the business makes a profit. Debt on the other hand, removes the risk of payback, although it is only paid off when the company makes a profit. the following are the pros and cons of each concerning a new business.\n\nPros for Equity Financing\nEquity financing has great benefits to investors in different ways. Firstly, it takes quite some time for businesses to raise capital through shareholders. Secondly, It allows an organization to grow and to raise money faster than any other financing option.\n\nPros for Debit Financing\nFuture growth of businesses, employee’s and owner’s in the company can be beneficial with debit financing. It also guarantees that the business pay the money back, as it is due for the debit financing. Lastly, with a larger amount of borrowed money which provides more cash to operate and invest a business.\nCons for Equity Financing\nRaising capital for a business has high risks and debit financing only involves paying back the money borrowed, with no additional profit sharing. Also equity financing can drown primary investors and the business itself and liquidity.\n\nCons for Debit Financing\nIf the business takes too long to gain profit, repaying of loans becomes a problem, and raising equity becomes crucial to meet up with any financial expenses that creep in. Also, if there is a high growth and demand for the business’ service or goods this can also become a major issue if the demand is too much for the capacity of the organization in terms of product capability.\n"

The terminal value of a company can be calculated using either Discounted Cash Flow Firm Value (DCF) or Free Cash Flow Firm Value (FCFF) model. The DCF model is sounds like more conceptually, gravitates more towards finance people, and has received a much higher level of validation if that makes sense. \n\nDividend Growth Model (DGM) of discounted cash flows  is an infinite growth model that lets the analyst estimate the growth rate of a company’s earnings. So if the Dividend Growth Model predicts a growth rate of 6 percent in a stock's dividends per annum for the next 10 years, it means that the stock will generate a dividend stream composed of:\n* A base rate payment in the first year,\n* The base rate (0%) plus growth (6%),\n* The base rate (0%) + growth (6%) + growth (6%),\n* The base rate (0%) + growth (6%) + growth (6%) + growth (6%)\n\nIn a Dividend Growth Model calculation, you subtract the terminal growth rate (i.e.: Market return - cost of equity). Because you set the terminal growth rate equal to the cost of equity which is commonly 7% for both the standard and aggressive attribute. So the cust of equity will be 0 and then you don't discount the last year's $50 of Dividend back to today's value and ignore $50 because, as the model is infinite, it doesn't earn dividend that year and sees $50 is the terminal value emitted in the eighth year of the projection. It tends to work better when the growth rate implies a return that’s outside of the normal costs of equity ranges.\n\nTo know more about the Modigliani-Miller Theorem: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modiglianimiller.asp\n\n## How to use your final solution when testResults[1] == True?\n\nIn order to make your GitHub markdown document good"

The input for the parameter length is a positive integer and represents the number of rows. The triangle pattern is defined through a set of rules.\n- Each row starts with the integer 1.\n- All rows must have length N + 2, where N represents the current row's number (which starts with 1).\n- For any given row number N, the ith cell must contain the entry (N choose P) where\nP is the position of that cell in the row, starting at 1 (first cell).\nChoose means the binomial coefficient choosing N / P and N P should be subtracted\nby 1 to calculate the exact result and avoid zerodivision error. If either one is\n0, the result is 1. For any given row, all values should be separated by one space.\nThe pattern ends when the first cell of a row becomes zero\n\nPlease generate a Python class called `Triangle` to achieve the above requirement:\n```python\ndef Triangle(length)\n    # Pick length, rows = list(range(1, length+1)) (length >= 1)\n    rows = [ 1, 2, 1 ]\n\n    # Do loops to get the triangle pattern\n    answer = ''\n    for row in rows:\n        answer += ' '.join(print_row(row)) + '\\n'\n    return answer\n    \ndef print_row(row):\n    # Do loops to get the row pattern for specific row \n    return [ 2, 1, 3, 1, 6, 1 ]\n```\n\nIt should work when I enter the following instructions:\n```python\nIn [1]: import triple\nIn [2]:"

Before clicking 'Submit', please unzip Python files and make sure your files name match.\n\n## Submission\n\nYou are given a starter code for this programming assignment (in the Python language), and the starter code is provided under respective subdirectories on Google Colab or in the Week 5 module’s GitHub repository (Q1.ipynb, Q2.ipynb, and Q3.ipynb). Each week has a subdirectory, i.e., Week 5, there is a repository for each week containing multiple Python files and each Python contains a question. Download all Python files from the new repository created for the week, and you upload the completed file to Google Colab. You can also use Ubuntu on your PC to upload the file to Google Colab. However, Google Colab is recommended, and you can ask for help if you have any issues.\n\nFor each assessment, the supporting document (Python files) attached to the submission tab will act as a Student Solution. Each student submission will be linked to the assessment files.\n\nHence, you will be assessed on the accuracy of your code, the coding standards (PEP8) and the completeness of your solution.\n\n## England Calling!

Run several scenarios, and each time you find that there is a trade, then add the price of said share bought/sold and the number of shares bought/sold to several lists, or add one number (cost of one share) to several lists.\n# Merge similar bids and ask orders. If there are two buyers, one offering to buy 1,000 shares at price £19.70, another offering to buy 300 shares at the same price, then add the shares of those two buyers together, yielding one bid of 1,300 shares at price £19.70 (So the user created two orders with the same price). Do something similar for the offers.\n# A buyer-seller pair is said to trade when the bid price is higher than or equal to the ask price. If this is the first time a trade is to be made in the current scenario dictated above, and John’s order is the bid order, then the price of the trade is simply John’s limit price. If both of the two buyers above trade, for example, they would realise an average price of £19.70, for it is their offer prices.

Therefore, bpv_of_short_tenor, bpv_of_long_tenor and conversion_factor are pre-defined.\n- To get the answer, we need to determine BPV_per_100000_in_par_value first. It is a product of bpv_of_long_tenor multiplied by conversion_factor divided by 100000. Then calculated the ratio between BPV_per_100000_in_par_value and 47.22, which means the number of five-year note futures contracts is required to readjust the immunizing portfolio."

With a problem definition string, you are telling the computer the given question, and the computer returns the answer. In contrast, a Python program is a set of instructions for a computer to calculate the answer, one step at a time.\n\nWhen you enter a string, the computer starts a program for you, behind the scenes. For example, when you ask the computer to divide two numbers, the computer begins this program:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Ask the user to input a value of dividend\n    dividend = eval(input(\"Please input the value of dividend: \"))\n    # Ask the user to input a value of divisor\n    divisor = eval(input(\"Please input the value of divisor: \"))\n    # Use the math operations to get the answer\n    answer = dividend / divisor\n    # return answer\n    return answer\n```\nJust like in the background the computer begins a program for you.

This is your opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge. You can provide an answer in the form of the following sample outputs. Note that the answer should be like this, the discussion of your expertise would not be included in the grading.\nAnswer: Interest rates are an important risk management tool for financial markets, companies, and central banks. The rate specifying a price for borrowed money for a fixed period can affect both consumers and producers, but is more important for them. Borrowers can switch to debt as many times as they desire, pursuing the most favorable rate. According to the consumer price index, it is frequently used as a variable cost in company profit margins and value standards. Businesses must pay interest to investors and the manufacturing, banking, and real estate sectors, where interest costs exceed production reimbursements. Governments can set it when the central bank manages monetary policy. The interest rate directly affects the three areas mentioned above by having actors modify their conduct and, in turn, business practices and preferences. The cost of investment-oriented services is reduced to keep firms competitive in the market, which can motivate managements to hire and secondary investments to be multiplied. Interest rates can make multiplicative investments to increase cash flow due to budget loans, allowing investors to benefit from positive effects.\n\nAdditionally, overpricing an asset can set firms competing for investment propositions. Rising interest rates equal falling bond and real estate asset costs in investment situations, altering investment choices to devalue cash. Increasing both production and interest costs serve as a deterrent, which businesses benefit. In a moment of financial stress, interest rates can assist the industry with funds. Finally, the supply of interest funds is a need factor for borrowing when investment,"

Check out this [link](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/s/split-multiplier) and we know that a higher split multiplier means more new shares per existing share, while a lower split multiplier stipulates fewer or no new shares. So we want an inverse fraction to the split multiplier (`2/1 = 1/0.5 = 2`)\n\nHint 2: There is the formula: 100 / p_to_spl = total_sh_outstanding * p_post_spl. Here, we have the original price to split which is 100. Total shares outstanding mean the number of contract(s) (= total shares before the split / split multiplier).

It indicates the sensitivity as per the reaction to the changes in market price to derive the assets returns from other related securities. Beta is a mathematical number to reflect managerial competence.\nA beta of less than 1 suggests that a manager is doing a worse job than the market's return. A beta equal to one indicates that the fund's return correlates exactly to the market's return. A beta greater than one indicates a manager is somehow beating the market. For example, if the market will rise over 10% in a year, a bet of less than 1 will rise less than 10%, while a bet greater than 1 (like 2) will resemble the market and rise more than 20% in that comparable time frame. The market price of this asset is influenced by the market's price more than any other asset, which is why the returned value is less than 1.\n</p>\n</details"

In addition, this kind of task can be solved in an easier way.\n\n\nHowever, questions with binary responses can't be solved in an easier way. It is not as easy as multiple choice questions. For example:\n\n\nQuestion: A debt consists of a zero-coupon bond worth 1000, that is redeemable in one year from today at a face value of 1000. If the risk-free interest rate is 2%, what is the fair value of the debt?\n\n\nIn addition, this kind of question will consider rounding error. So it is very possible you don't get 1000 with your answer. So I think you should have a more flexible answer. The best answer is using four decimal. In this case, you still don't get 1000 with your answer but you should have a minimum of 3 decimal number, and the gap should be smaller than 0.001. You should also have a step of 0.01 on rounding your number. And You should be able to calculate the rounding error.\n\nHow to get a better rounding error check? Dylan also mentioned a good approach. If the number of decimal place can cast as well as the expected decimal place, then we can round with the answer. Otherwise, it is not the final answer! We round the number first and then see its decimal place is equal to the expected decimal place or not.\n\n\nHere is the example of the Python program:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    zero_coupon_bond_face_amount = 1000\n    year_rate = 2\n    expected_decimal = 3\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    fair_value = zero_coupon_bond_face"

Same is the case with operating profit margin, interest burden, ROE, etc. After the variables are defined, you should solve the problem.\n\nIn your output, please define the variables by using meaningful names only. We won't change the names of the variables in your answer, so ensure that you verbalize the names very carefully and write them thoughtfully.\n\nContinue your output:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    profit_margin = 0.1\n    asset_turnover = 1.5\n    leverage = 1.6\n    interest = 0.8\n    ROE = 0.144\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n\n```\nIn this output, we have defined the variables. Pay attention to the variable `ROE`. The question is asking us to find the average tax rate. If we spot variable `ROE` in the question, we should know that it has been used in many financial algorithms. For solving these algorithms, we have pre-built Python functions for `return_on_equity`, `equity_multiplier`, and `taxes_on_earnings`.\n\n`return_on_equity` needs the company's `net income`, `total stockholder's equity`, and the `taxes_on_earnings` variable. However, we don't have the `total stockholder's equity` variable in the question. So, we need to define it by using other variables.\n\n`equity_multiplier` requires the `debt`, `assets`, and the `taxes_on_earnings` variables. This can be calculated by the provided `ROE` variable.\n\n`taxes_on_earnings` needs the firm's `earnings` variable. Earning in the context of earning before the interest burden, means the operating profit of the firm.\n\nWe can get the company's total shareholders' equity and firm's earnings by solving the equations. The answer for these variables are / return on equity will be:\n```python\nequity_multiplier("

Let us assume that John can bring A truck to carry out duty and only one person can ride with A truck. When John moves one trash can filled with K kilograms of trash, then the truck use the E_unit meter of gas. Karl spends B_unit of money in gasoline per month, and the cost of a month can be obtained with a formula gas_cost = E_unit \\* (B_unit / 100) / (K ** 2). John thinks that the higher level of E_unit, the lower level of gas cost, and the lower level of B_unit, the lower level of gas cost. However, John thinks that the higher level of B_unit, the shorter level of K, and if he uses a smaller trash can, then he spends less money for gasoline. Write a Python program, which used NPV to choose the appropriate trash can and truck for gas-cost consideration.

This will enable you to know precisely those financial questions that are frequently asked and, as such, answer them effortlessly.\n\n1. Bridging earlier default views, John Challenger said in a post-election interview that: The most important  historical indicator for forecasting future layoffs and unemployment rates is the aftermath of US presidential elections, including the percentage of white-collar workers fired in the 180 days before the election.\n\n2. Following personal tax cuts, there have been sustained increases in consumer spending, absent reports of unipolar monetary policy concerns about monetary policy restrictions after the last do passive monetary expansion policies.\n\nGuessing at the areas that are susceptible to changes is appropriate in this context. Betting on activities that change with a variable output like interest rates in particular is incomprehensible. Because the value of the currency fluctuates with interest rates, it is impossible to carry out meaningful comparisons in most circumstances. On the other hand, it's crucial to understand the monetary policy implications of variable interest rates. This kind of information helps you forecast trends in the stream of economic indicators, which would otherwise be impossible. Regarding layoffs, there is no quantifiable approach to forecasting layoffs forecasts. Therefore, those who analyze changes in US presidential elections can determine what programmatic changes will be made on both sides during a time that they will be put in place. As a result, forecasting job layoffs for US presidential elections is a straightforward task for them.\n\nThe event for which a program is created is accessible with the variable event.

It is about mixing profit and nurturing future communities – companies thriving for future generations, in all aspects. \n\nIt’s not only a new form of investment that is viable, but the concept comes in four distinct categories. These include inactive, active, growth and value investing. The classification most popular is still the growth investing sort. Growth investing is considered most favourable because it involves the chance to invest in institution with agreements to help promote the economy. Working in the markets involves investors culture of purpose; for instance, the ability to promote creative and useful ideas among team members. \n\nPurpose-led firms have a 50% greater potential to achieve ''stock performance'' and are rewarded with a consistent social and environmental responsibility organisation. Investment then, is more than just satisfied by profits, but through positive equality.\n"

In business, we call this \"bank account self underwriting\" or \"liquid net worth\". The background for this is:\n- Apart from all market regulations, no single firm or organization can arrange for every legally enforceable transaction where he or she buys and sells units called \"assets\" every quarter, being paid units called \"liabilities\".\n- The accounting account of assets and liabilities has a balance carefully crafted, where \"assets\" minus \"liabilities\" \"=\" \"equity\" over a chosen account period.\n- Further, our palpable world alone consists of inflatable ecosystems which hydrostatically require active rescues before a drawn-out bankruptcy. This should not stop the firm from meeting its equity requirement, which is again an accounting standard approximating how much cash could change hands.\n- As the cash can only be saved in a bank account paying interest, the owner can withdraw more than he or she put in by the interest earned. Having a correct bank account balance he or she can buy legal liabilities for these assets at market price, reducing his/her assets to 0.\n- By doing so, the firm (that is his or her net worth) has a liquid balance which corresponds to its equity account.

Loris asks has asked Herman. Write a program that accepts four inputs: (i) the starting-year for the 30-year benefit period; (ii) one's expected annual pension; (iii) the annual interest rate to be applied to the pension's savings account; and (iv), the annual inflation rate. The program returns a message as output saying whether or not the expected pension is exhausted upon death given the other four inputs.\n\n**Remark:**This problem is changed from the original HNG104 (Part A).

It can be used to update probabilities using prior knowledge.\n\n1. Bayes’ Law in Python 3\n\nWrite a Python3 program to calculate Bayes' Law. Suppose you know a person is diagnosed with a serious disease and you know the probability of the disease given the symptoms. What is the probability that the person actually has the disease if they exhibit those symptoms?\n\n```include\nplt_content/plt_tupleB.Rmd\n```\nIMAGE\n```{image} ./images/plt_tupleB.PNG\n:alt: Tuple\n:align: center\n:width: 40%\n```\n\n\nContinue:\n* Ask the construction site owner for the relevant parameter values.\n* Apply Bayes' rule for calculating posterior probabilities.\n* Discuss the inferences on probability of the construction site being reset based on the new data.\n\n\n## Exercise 5: Classify Loans\n\nUsing statistical methods, whether machine learning or predictive modeling, lenders can evaluate a loan applicant’s creditworthiness.
