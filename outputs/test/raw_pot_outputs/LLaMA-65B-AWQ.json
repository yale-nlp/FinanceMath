This error behavior is somewhat similar to\n**Tricky Bug Report 1**. (v4)\nOn rare occasions, this error message may appear in seemingly obvious situations, e.g. the sample answer:\n```py\ndef getAnswer(num1, num2):\n    \n    r = int(num1 / num2)\n    print(r)\n    \ndef solution():\n    getAnswer(22, 7)\n```\nAlthough it is highly unlikely, this error message may appear in such a scenario upon difficulty scaling because such an arrangement of the Python code may affect the order of program execution.\nAs per the above scenario, if some modification is required, please update the program as follows:\n```py\ndef getAnswer():\n    r = int(num1 / num2)\n    return r\n\ndef solution():\n    print(getAnswer(22, 7)\n```\n\nAdditionally, the included segments, like `int(num1 / num2)`, can be replaced with `float(num1 / num2)`, in order to produce floating-point answers, which depend on the nature of the input values.\n\nQuestion"

            "    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    \n    # return answer\n```\n\nExplanation and Limitation\n\nThis example assumes the following:\n\nThe maximum leverage ratio is defined as the maximum of NT/MB. For each product group, assume that while taking NT/MB (normally equal to 100), the maximum leverage ratio is observed. If the market price is strictly positive no matter what, the leverage ratio never falls below 1 for a given NT/MB.\n\nThe maximum leverage ratio is geometric, not arithmetic. To use credit to enter the trade, the trader borrows at the overnight interest rate, O, which is positive in real markets, but often ignored by traders. Then the overnight leverage ratio is T/ (NT + MO), where M is the notional amount of overnight credit used and O is the overnight financing rate. The overnight leverage ratio is geometric because we have to take the homomorphic extension of the extended real arithmetic (-∞,−1]∪[0,∞) into the compact extended real numbers [−∞,+∞]. In discrete time trading models, this corresponding interest rate is typically Rn+1/Rn= (1+O)^(1/¶)=eO. In continuous time, this daily interest rate is eort/360, for some positive constant ort, in turn, the interest rate over any period of time (per year in particular) is given by eortrt/360."

You are encouraged to do this in a functional and modular way. The written part of the task, the HTML, JS and CSS you use are separately commented and submitted.\n\nThis is how the user interface should appear and function:\n\n* A widget should be shown, with a random number between 1 and 100 displayed, and the text \"Predict the number\" just above the widget.\n* Clicking the \"Reset\" button should reset the widget and the random number should appear again.\n* The user should be able to enter a number in the widget (\"Prediction\") at any given time, press \"Submit\" and see \"Correct!\" appear just below the widget if the prediction matches the random number. If it doesn't, \"Nope, try again!\" should appear instead. (The user can make numerous guesses and you should be able to accept all their input.)\n\nThe e-mail should contain five things:\n\n1. The HTML, CSS and JS files of the program, as well as a sequence number (in parentheses) to uniquely identify the assignment (e.g. HelloWorld_1.html )\n\n2. The width and height in pixels you used in the HTML file to display the widget.\n\n3. The draw method of the widget you wrote using a canvas element would look like if your program was run in a web browser.\nNote that this does not concern the random number, but the widget itself (e.g. starting with a small blue square in the upper left-hand corner and ending with Happy faces all around the edge of the widget and in the"

A poor consumer may be indifferent between buying a loaf of bread or a bottle of wine, but with more wealth, he would be able to buy both. Given more wealth, consumers behave as though they are operating along a utility function. Generally, we say that they are operating along a separable utility function if for any number of goods and any prices, they maximize utility by allocating a portion of their income (with rescaling) to each good such that the marginal utility of each good divided by its price is equal. In this experiment script, we look at a simple utility function, then the utility function adjusted by income, and plot the implied demand curves.\n\n\n```python\n# Import module B1 module for this problem\ndef solution():\n    from B1solution import"

Before the announcement, U's transaction price per share was 15 euros, and it appreciated to €20 per share with the expectation of the fusion deal getting necessary permissions and successfully concluding. If we assume the fusion between B and U comes to a successful close, what will be the result of Smith’s merger arbitrage trade if he purchases 24,000 U shares at a rate of 20 euros per share, and goes short on 16,000 B shares at a rate of 45 euros per share?",

Please improve your formating fot the example as it is not clear.\n\nAnswer: This is an exercise that can be solved analytically as well. See how I compute `m` from two input arguments `r`, the tax rate and `mp`, the marginal propensity to consume:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef solution(r=0.25, mp=0.7):\n    ## Define variables name and value\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    c = 1 - r * mp;\n    y = mp + c * mp + c ** 2 * mp + c ** 3 * mp\n    m = 1 / (1 - (mp + c * mp)/mp * c)\n\n    print(\"the fiscal multiplier is \", m)\n    ## return answer\n    return m\n\n>>> solution(0.25, 0.7)\nthe fiscal multiplier is  0.03234491747189512\n\n>>> solution(0.50, 0.7)\nthe fiscal multiplier is  0.2101735870763164\n\\end{code}\n\nSince not much effort is required to guess what `c` and `y` are, I will leave the computations for this step to the reader. Getting the value of the fiscal multiplier requires a degree in maths. I will refer to a lecture on [Fiscal Multipliers](https://sites.sas.ac.uk/happiness-and-history/%27/files/2018/05/17_Lecture_2_-_Fiscal_multipliers_20180521.pdf) by Samuel Bowles.

Please ensure all figures, including mathematical equations, to be processed by harvesters are self-generated by Python programs like the one demonstrated above.\n\nComment: Seems a bit like you'd be better just asking at Math SE\n\nComment: Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it's currently written, it's hard to tell exactly what you're asking.\n\nAnswer: This problem can be solved using the Z-Normal approach. This works because of the requirement for the cumulative default rate\n(CCR) to be less than 260% for a rating of BBB. Also:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item for a CCR = 260% cumulatively, ratings migrate directly to BB. Default rate is about 6.8% annually, allocating the loss in an 80/20\nsplit.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nConsider a BBB rated bond with an annual yield spread of 2.5% and a differential of\n1%, split between credit and non-credit components. Credit rating agencies use\nZ-score analysis for credit ratings, with the long-term expected cumulative probability\nof default represented by:\n\nZ = 1.645 (1 - default rate) ^ (-1) (default estimate)\n\nZ-score requires the standard deviation of the original lognormal random variable. To\nfind this, use:\n\nLognormalPDF =  ln(P) * P/(1-P) / (ln(P)) ^ 2 / 2\n\nWith P representing the probability of default and ln(P) representing the cumulative\nprobability of default. This can be stated as Z = 1.645 / LognormalPDF.\n\nUsing the equation:\n\n95% (1-P) = 32 / Z = 1.645\n\nto solve for Z-score, which gives a loss given default rate of 60%, the answer becomes\n\nZ = SQRT(142 / 2.5) Z-score ="

The fund entered a completely secured long futures agreement in nearby soybean futures agreements at the listed futures cost of 755.0 (US cents/bushel). After three months, the entire futures agreement was shifted when the near-term futures cost was 768.0 and the further-term futures cost was 773.0. Throughout the three-month timeframe between the initiation of the initial long agreement and the adjustment of the contract, the security earned an yearly rate of 0.40%.

We filmed the bottom with our video camera - and were shocked by what we saw. There were no fish on the bottom; the fishing was terrible - all we caught was an empty radioactive canister.\n(We were careful enough to examine our television monitor onboard; when we watched a TV program, we kept high-caducity and did not have any \"eyeache\".)\nHowever, we did get a few"

It is optional to define function, but function puts your code into a meaningful package, which is useful in file management. Function provides you parametric control over the arguments of the program. Besides, it enables you to define nested functions.\n\n\n### Input Requirements\n\n    - There should be no input parameters for the function.\n\n\n### Output Requirements\n\n    - Naturally, the output should be given through return.\n    - Besides the function return value, we do not require any other output.\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n    - The function should produce the correct solution in the least amount of space, when measured in LOC. The LOC is calculated as: \"number of tokens in the solution x (1 - the number of nested comments present in solution)\" divided by 2. A nested comment is any comment which occurs completely within another comment. Partial nested comments do not affect the number of nested comments.\n    - The function should be deterministic - always produce the correct answer given the same input of data in the least amount of time. \n    - It should be impossible to interrupt, pause or stop the function during its run.\n    - The function should be secure - it must be impossible to warp or modify data, format or human-readable text during the function's execution.\n    - The program must be capable of running at least twice in a very short amount of time - sometimes, you will be asked to run the function repeatedly in the contests. We do not require the program to run at the speed of light, but we do require the execution to be relatively fast. For example, optimization contests run 10 repeated executions of each solver, and the total execution time is limited to 15 seconds for all 10 executions. In some contests, your entry may also be subject to Little's Law type testing - if the execution time of the function is high, but the correct LOC of code is low. \n\n\n### About assumptions\n\n    - All extra unknown inputs should be assumed to have default values:\n                        - zero for numbers\n                        - 'Blue' for strings\n                        - False for Boole"

The king, her husband sends you to the knights' castle in the country to rescue her. \n\nYou learn that the castle is laid out as a rectangle of rooms with one entrance (at the top of one of the castle's two long sides) and one exit (at the bottom of the long side opposite the entrance). The escape route from the castle is for this reason known as the \"Escape Corridor\". All the doors in the castle have one-way locks that open in the direction of the Escape Corridor. This is to enable the inhabitants to quickly reach the Escape Corridor in case of an emergency. \n\nEach room contains some knights (armed!). Your weapons are poor ones - you have only two daggers in your belt. There is a weightlifting room that has a heavy wooden pole with a hook on its end. You can pick the pole up and carry it into another room. \n\nYou should proceed directly to towards the Escape Corridor as fast as possible. However, there are too many knights on the way towards the exit, you have to collect the wooden pole to beat them. The pole can be used to defeat the knights in later rooms as well. \n\nThe queen is held in a special golden cage in the castle's \"Main Room\" (the room right in the middle of the top floor). If captured, the knights will take you immediately to imprison the queen to the golden cage and also lock you inside it. \n\nYou want to kill the queen once captured, so that she can join you in the afterlife (the queen may provide help with your escape, though). So you cannot rescue the queen without the pole, which is stored in the gym room.

The input pipe connects your program to the outside world so your program can receive various types of inputs in real time that is given to your program. The format of the input pipe STDIN is in the following format.\n\n1\n7\n4\n2\n6\n5\n7\nNext line, empty line, or EOF(Ctrl+z on Unix, Ctrl+Break on Windows) terminates the input and the program should print the final answer to the STDOUT, which is an output pipe connected to your program. The output will be collected for marking. STDOUT is in the following format. Note, you will be given a time budget of 5 seconds per integer input. Each test case will consist of 10 randomly generated integers at most.\n\n---Part 2 Hint---\n\nSometimes in probability theory, you will come across mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Formally, two events are mutually exclusive when they share no outcomes. That is, A and B are mutually exclusive when A∩B = 0, where ∩ denotes the intersection of two sets of elements. Being mutually exclusive is sufficient for both events to be considered independent. For example:\n\n-> a 6-sided die landed showing a 5 or a 3; let A={ die landed showing a 5}, B={die landed showing a 3}.\n-> Possible outcomes of the die roll are 1,2,3,4,5,6\n-> Intersection of A and B only contains 1 outcome, which has measure 1/6\n\n\nIf events A and B are mutually exclusive, then by definition no elements are shared between the two events, and thus whenever an outcome is in A, it will not be in B, and vice versa."

That is true, variable values are designed to be temporary. Once the function's runtime is done, variable values will vanish as well. You can consider a variable name as a pointer to a storage space. When the program makes use of the variable name, the used space will change its value accordingly. That is how data are transferred and processed in a program. Once the pointer is returned back to the original value, the usage of the storage space ends.\nIn the above example, question values and answer are not variables but literals, they do not disappear during runtime and do not need to be defined so that their values will not vanish."

We have to do both, but we have to emphasize both parts are aligned with what Smith intends. In other words, at the end we must clearly discuss how implementing ML fits into Smith's strategy for StatFin.\n\nFirst, our answer needs to emphasize that clearly machine learning is a powerful set of tools for analyzing data BUT a powerful tool is only helpful if it's used correctly. And you can only use it correctly in the appropriate context. So in this case, the request for a machine learning model comes from Smith the CMO. Here, the analysis of sentiment will improve the competitive ability of StatFin both in supplying well-researched market reports and in communicating well with business partners. So the choice to implement ML is radically context dependent.\n\nSecond, Smith's desire to introduce a ML model MUST be interpreted properly. Like most tech VCs, Smith is known to often use buzzwords and hype phrases. The ML method that Smith's request talks about is not your standard machine learning method. It is a fundamentally new method and uses several techniques from various subfields of machine learning, each making a contribution to enhancing the prediction capabilities of the analytics conducted by StatFin.\n\nYour misunderstanding has not been to see that Smith's request should be seen not as REPLACING the process at StatFin, but as IMPROVING upon the process in ways that are beneficial to both Smith and to StatFin. But we also need to understand that improved accuracy is NOT what Smith has in mind since the StatFin process provides plenty of accuracy overall. So we really need to lay the groundwork with Smith for the next step of ACTIONABILITY in his analytics results.\n\n- Input and output must meet the problem specifications (see below).

It is a briefly list of elements and positioned in sorted order such that the least element in the list can be shown quickly. However, in this article a Fibonacci Heap has the ability to extract the least element in addition to insert, delete and merge elements.\n\nHere is an example of a Fibonacci Heap:\n\n    1 3 4 9\n    10 (13)\n    \nA (13) is not a Fibonacci heap element and is called Mark. Fibonacci Heap, labeled with Mark (13), shows that a heap element 13 has been merged with the list rooted at a node 1. There is never a population greater than 2 * branchingFactor elements, where branchingFactor = Math.sqrt (8) / 2. In each of the four heap nodes there is a pointer to a child node. If a node is not nil, the child is a Mark-Clone of the parent, and their value is the sum of the edges between the parent nodes.\n\nThe top two are within the insert method and the top two are within the delete method itself, in green and red arrows.\n    \n    4 5\n       1 \n       8\n    7 (6)\n    \n\nDuring the merge operation, the two elements are the root vertices, and the heap guide (shown in green) points to the top of one of the node pair to be merged. Meanwhile, the right arrow marked in red means that the merge procedure will create cloned pointers from the last to last (not the last pair). But the triplet shall now be generated into a doublet (ex: clone ptr 1 and ptr 2 -> ptr 13). Furthermore, the pointer/node indicated in blue is a Mark pointer. Thus, a node in blue is referred to as a MarkWrite node and a Mark node is found to be the node indicated by purple color.\n\nConsistently writing out a (Fibonacci) heap guide we are"

Despite the annoyance of the internal representation in Zinc, there is no difficulty in decomposing the problem into parameters, decision variables, and constraints. Here's what to do:\n\nFind out as much as you can from the question what information is needed and what are the requirements needed. This can be done through a human-readable representation using colors to mark them in the Constrained Slot form of Requirement Poems.\n\nConvert the essential parameters and decision variables into a formal\n!ひかる}{{\n\nConvert the unary relationships between the parameters into binary relations, but only within the non-atomic environment context. Keep numbers in the non-atomic environment, unless there is a good reason to leave them as parameters. Use connection assertions to incorporate most of the numerical relations between parameters in the non-atomic context. For numeric values in the atomic context, make sure that they are introduced relative to a antecedent or precedence constraint. However, if an exceedingly large gating parameter is needed such as to define a search tree, that parameter can be made with a simplifying comment And must be either the number of a possible answer or a fraction of this number.\n\nConnect the requirements for atoms, to the various factors being introduced. The activity of knowledge of the connection with the chemical element is extraordinary for the writing\n\nIt is essentially a multiple selection where there is a problem, and the multi-shot requirements can have only one or more possible solutions.\n\nIn Constrained Slot form, there is one requirement. The second constraint is the task constraint\n\nIn Zinc, there are several connection constraints to define the anchor from the atomic point to the list of elements to be chosen."

We can set up a table to the solution:\n\nMarket                 Capacity       Profit\nSocks                       100          500\nSocks                       120          590\n\nSince this intersects both tables, we can therefore make it into a quadratic function:\nMarket = 100 + (590 - 500) / 20 * x^2 - 10 * x\nGiven that socks can be sold up to 120 or, Market = 120\n(Socks - 100) / 20 * x^2 - 10x = -20\nFactorize:\n(x - 10)(x + 2) = -20\nSo there are two solutions given this equation, 2 and 10\nTherefore there are two inflection points, 8 and 108.\nThis is the graph of the equation:\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nTo test your code, you need to write it to a .py file and run it on a terminal.

This transaction constitutes either a secured or an unsecured loan depending on the down payment initially made by John to secure financing from Bank XYZ, which is expressed as a fraction of the home's purchase price. This transaction is deemed a secured loan if and only if John's down payment is larger than or equal to the amount of $35,000. For example, John would have made a secured loan to finance the purchase of a $100,000 home if he had saved for a down payment of $54,565, thus leaving $35,000 and $0 as his resultant amounts financed and borrowed, respectively. Determine if the $35,000 financing secured by a home's given purchase price constitutes a secured or an unsecured loan.\n\nInput\nThe only line of input consists of a single integer pi (1 pi 100), the fraction of the home's purchase price that is financed.\n\nOutput\nOutput \"Secured\" (without quotes) if the $35,000 loan is secured.

See how the returns behave with inflation. Look at March, where inflation was ~3.1, and SPRJ_US_TOPIX was .67374998, so its retun in local % P/Y was just over 208. Then look at April or Feb., when the inflation was around 3.27 to 3.34, and the returns were over 100%. And in May, they fell to just over -6% (interestingly, it follows the US earlier). In June, the inflation was ~0.18, and the return was ~-0.26, so the annualized local returns still favored that month.\n\nSo you should be able to answer your question using the monthly returns, and the monthly data should only be downloaded once (via pandas_datareader, see examples on how to do this).\n\nUnfortunately I'm not familiar with Python, but in R you can generate an annualized return column per the below code, and paste that into Nuclino:\n\n\\begin{code}\ndf$Total.Annual.Return = na.omit(cumprod(df$Local.Return)*12)\ndf$Local.Total.Annualized.Return = c(0, diff(df$Total.Annual.Return))\n\\end{code}\n\nSee [link to FR's dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jc3294/fr-sensex-treasury) for the data. I used that link to import into R/Python.\n\nNo no need to download or read it client side, it all takes place on the server. You might encounter memory issues if you try to read a large file client side (in Python), and with R you'll have issues because R runs as ram only.\n\nSo, to answer your question"

Or are they actually the same problem ?\n\nAnswer: Recipe for things like this, first iterate the values in a loop, second interpolate the data. To do what you want, we iterate your input to see the data, then we use a dict to organize out how to get to the input we need.\n\n\\begin{code}\n#  You will need to define your inputs to the block of text, in this example, I define three variables\n#  See comments, good practice for people who will consume your code later :)\ndef solution():\n    CASH =30000\n    ACCOUNT_RECEIVABLE =40000\n    INVENTORIES =36000\n\n    company = input()\n    for hid in company.split(\"\\n\"):\n        # Iterate our Text lets split them up by newlines\n        items = hid.split(\":\")[ : 2 ]\n        # Items are a couplet we want inputs and output stored in a dict\n        # Lets define our dictionary\n        outputs = items[1].split(\" \")\n        # Outptust are a space delimited list\n        # Because accounts were inconsistently case we must convert them all to lowercase / Create your own Exceptions with Least Privlige (that is your block here)\n        # At the same time as we loop through we create a\n        outputs_lower = [ j.lower() for j in outputs ]\n        #Lets decide how to use this data, we choose the methods to solving it in a pythonic way\n        cash_convert = (CASH)/(INVENTORIES/(ACCOUNT_RECEIVABLE - 40000))\n        #Gives us the total amount (inventory)\n        #By subtracting the account recievable (40000),\n        #We have made a variable cash_convert for the Output, but what if we want to print it\n        print"

Lately the product is extended \nbeyond early stage and loses money in early states. Your team decides to invest \nmore 200 to keep the product near break-even. What would be the new discount \nrate for your product to prevent others in the team from investing further. \nSuppose early and late development costs are 2 and 3 and late profitability is \n1.\n\nHint: Please notice the problem is asking you about the new discount rate, not the \ncurrent discount rate. So even though the late stage profitability changed from \n-4 to -3, this is still an unattractive project and you should keep the discount rate for calculating VNP according to this unattractiveness.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the expected number of cohorts we can make if we start with the mono-ethnic cohort of Shanghainese female was selected by advertisement and random sampling?\n\nInput: participated_sample_id, 802\n\nOutput: 54.38333573719581\n\nHint: Specifically, exactly how many ethnicity subpopulations and how many gender subpopulations contained in the given proportion of female and multi-ethnic cohort?\n\"\"\""
