He gathers data on the 72 stocks in the fund, taking company size as an independent variable. The results of estimating the model Ri = b0 + b1(Sizei) + b2(D/Ei) + ει are shown in Exhibit 1. Collins compares the projections of his model to the actual ROE for two portfolio stocks, X and Y, both with identical debt ratios but with market capitalizations of EUR 100 million and 200 million respectively. According to Collins' regression analysis, how much higher is the ROE for company X than for company Y (in percentage points)?",
