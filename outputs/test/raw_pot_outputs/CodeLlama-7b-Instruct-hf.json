And we want to calculate the initial deferred tax liability by straight-line depreciation over 10 years with no salvage value. In this case, the equal annual depreciation can be applied over 10 years to derive the IATL; then we can calculate the accelerated depletion to find AVD. Then we use the deferred tax liability formula to find DTL. Finally, we get the final answer as DTL. Note that the tax rate stays at 40%.\n\n\nQuestion: Detailed tax return can be returned in the document, but here is the output from Quickbooks:\n\nAccount No.\tDescription\tAmount\tDebit/Credit\tBalance\ngl\t4300\tAccrued expenses\t$4639.98\tCr\n4507\tAccrued tax Liability\t$-4639.98\tDr\n---- Store Sales ----\n4462\tRevenue\t\t$1482.62\tCr\n4054\tInventory sold\t$1483.72\tCr\n5075\tOther operating expense\t$129.08\tCr\ngl\t4300\tAccrued expenses\t$3797.48\tCr\n4507\tAccrued tax liability\t$-3797.48\tDr\n\n\nPlease generate a Python program to get the answer.

The reason is two-fold:\n\n1. An employee is only as valuable as the working conditions he or she can work under; anyone who is ostracized by his or her employer is not a valuable employee.\n2. Working conditions tend to lead to feelings of dissatisfaction; everyone gets sick of working in an uncaring workplace.\n\nAs a result, companies always aim to balance their wage payable with their taxes and employee incentives such as bonuses and fringe benefits. After deducting expenses from the revenue, we don't know how much actual wages were actually disbursed to our workers. So, we have to take the wage payable and divide it with the revenue, and call the answer \"days' salary deferred\", DSD.\n\nAssuming that the company has a single income stream (no float-value profit), the formula for days' salary deferral (DSD) is as follows:\n\nDSD = income / (income - other deductions)\n\nIn our case, the income is the same and the only variable changing is the number of deductions so that's the final answer.\n\nSoln:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    wage_payable = 8887754\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    answer = wage_payable / revenue\n    \n    # return answer"

The system records every transaction that pays a supplier. There are 1 transaction type: \"debit\" or \"credit\". When a customer buys a product from a supplier, the customer's account (which is a type of \"credit\" account balance) is decreased to show the payment made by the customer, while the supplier's account (which is a type of \"debit\" account balance) is increased to show the payment received by the supplier, and a new transcation record is inserted into the transaction table. When the customer wants to cancel a transaction, the customer account is increased and the supplier's account is decreased.\n\nThe transaction table is a table that records all the payment transactions between a customer and a supplier. The table name is \"tran_table\", the field name is transaction id, and the data type is big integer, and it is the unique id of a transaction record. The table structure is:\ncustomer id, customer account debit, customer account credit, customer account balance, supplier id, supplier account debit, supplier account credit, supplier account balance, transaction type, and the transaction amount and time.\n\nIf a customer and a supplier cancel a transcation, it will be reflected in the transaction table.\nFor example, when a customer buys a product from a supplier, the record (customer id, company id, customer account debit, customer account, customer account balance, supplier id, supplier account debit, supplier account credit, supplier account balance and the transaction type\"debit\" and transaction amount and date) will be inserted into the transaction table.

Today is a Thursday. You borrow $100,000 at the start of the week. The cash flow within the week is $18,000, and $3,000 cannot be repaid on time. On week days, your repayment is 100,000 / 52 + 18,000 + 3,000 = $108,503 per week. On Sunday when the interest rates range from 8% to 12% on Thursday, you are borrowing $100,000 at $18.33 per week, you will have to pay less because of the discounting. The weekly repayment is 100,000 / 52 + 18,000 + 3,000 = $107,773 this week. If you continue borrowing and repaying the loan pool at the same rate for 365 days, your debt will be $105,998 at the end of the year. How much will you have borrowed at the start of the year if you discount the applied interest?\n\nYou are a financial analyst, you are supposed to generate a Python program to answer the given question.

This portfolio has an annualized return of 12% and an annualized return volatility of 25%.",

Annualized return is calculated by multiplying daily returns by the number of trading days in a year, which is 365, you can imagine 252 also. However, the portfolio's value following the event are not given therefore they are ignored in the analysis.\n\nTo calculate the statistical expectation of a variable X that determines the daily change of the value of the portfolio, we are given the following CDF:\n\nF(X) = P(X ≤ x) = 1 - 0.5^(5* x^2/10) = 1 - 0.5^(x), for X ≤ 5\n\nThe corresponding PDF linearizes the CDF; PDF(X) = 1/20* 5^(-x/10) = 1/20 * 5^(-x) for x ≤ 5. This distribution is bell shaped, which mean the portfolio's value changes normally. Therefore we cannot assume the daily value change is under Cauchy distribution:\n\nC(x) = 1/(π*(x-μ)^2 + σ^2) = 1/(π*x^2 + σ^2)\n\nTo calculate the 4 sigma value of the portfolio, see this example:\n\nmove down the diagram, a portfolio's value changes about 4 sigma today;\n\n![alt text](https://kr4igxftp.fa.yahoo.net/b?store=he_he/slot1/lo-bats_bs&transaction=d&transid=10000000&adid=2958397)\n\nIf portfolio's annualized return is "

You will need to implement solution method, write your own calculation logic, then change the `answer=0` to `answer=your_answer`, finally, run the test, and see the result.\n\nFile `check.py` is in root of this repo and contains a helper function `check(code, answer, question)` to generate code template and run unit test for you.

Python was originally created as the opposition to Java, which, at the time, was the market leader in coding the web applications for web browsers. Because of this competition, Google decided to acquire Python to stop it from being in the hands of Microsoft, the competitor to Google. Python was introduced in version 2.4 and has been made available publicly since. (Source: Peer 1: The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Henry S. Warren Jr. December 5, 2012)\n```\n\n\n4.

If he uses an insolvency prediction model, he discovers that 70% of the bonds will be given a \"good\" rating, suggesting they are less likely to become insolvent.

(Hint, let P(A) be the probability of insolvency, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" rating, P(B | A) be the likelihood of a \"good\" rating given insolvency, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of insolvency given a \"good\" rating.)",

There, what matter is the \"promotion\", not his \"salary increase\". In other words, this problem can be solved by \"looking only at the big picture\". In this case, it's not a matter of the \"distribution of wages\".\n\n* You may also want to know that the corresponding equation of [Hobson-Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%E2%80%93Williams_tuple) is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Case 5} = 1 - \\frac{1- \\text{f2}}{1 + \\text{f2}} - \\text{f2"

Please write a function `get_productivity_bonus(productivity_percentage)` to calculate this bonus for a given `productivity_percentage.` There are the following variations:\n\n* If productivity is above 10% but below 15%, the bonus is 10%.\n* If productivity is above 15% but below 20%, the bonus is 15%.\n* If productivity is above 20%, the bonus is 20%.\n\nExample:\n\nAssume you want to calculate the bonus for an employee including 25% productivity. If you use your function to calculate the bonus, it adds up to `$29.17` if you choose the plus sign `+` for the calculation, and `$37.28` if you choose the bitwise OR `bio` for the calculation.\n```python\n# suppose that the productivity percentage is 25%\nbonus = get_productivity_bonus(0.25)\n\n# You can use either the plus sign or the bitwise OR to calculate `bonus`,\n# just like this:\n# bonus = get_productivity_bonus(0.25, '+')\n# or,\n# bonus = get_productivity_bonus(0.25, 'bio')\n\nprint(\"The productivity bonus is $%.2f.\" %(bonus))\n```\n\nWhat the function should return is the productivity bonus, which is the amount of money the employee gets as a bonus for working hard.\n\nQuestion: You have $2000 in your savings account.

In here, you are using Aswath Damodaran to calculate delta of an option with cashed in option if the option is already expired. Hence it is not used in the paper.\n\nQuestion Script:\n[//]: # (Answer)\n[//]: # ({\\displaystyle h-f(h)+{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial h}}(f(h)){\\Big |}h={\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\Big |}_{\\infty }}) Probably, the correct answer is (+ of the delta of $f$ and $- of the delta of $f$), why?\n```\nQuestions:\n- What is the formula for the Black-Scholes value and its delta?\n- What is the definition of Ichimoku cloud?\n- When does Einstein cross the border in his image?\n- Why is Trump so concerned about the “crime problem” in Chicago?"

Running the above code will give you zero grade since the return statement is missing. Notice that the assignment statement is not in a function and function is not called. Also, any output is nothing but printed at the end of the program. You MUST use return to finish your program.\n\nNote that non-return result will kill the program and terminate it.\n\nhttps://wenyujun1.github.io/wenyujun1.github.io/blog/zero-coupon-bond-practice.html"

If you have a good sales performance in December, do not forget to calculate the MRR in December. e.g. MRR = (MRR in December + current_MRR + cumulative_growth + future_growth) / 6\n* Note that the interest payment is not fixed, it depends on how long you have a loan. And up to what point the loan can flow backwards\n  to you. Therefore, instead of only considering the short-term (should I start sending interest to the borrowers?) vs long-term (should\n  I restructure the loan finance again?) choice as the only factor, you need to consider both factor together before making a\n  decision.\n* `sys.exit` can be your best friend. It is a built-in function that ends the program when it is called. e.g. `sys.exit(42)`\n* `range(10, 101, 10)` is an array of length 9 that stores numbers from 10 to 100 in steps of 10. e.g. 10, 20, ..., 90, 100\n* `list(range(10, 101, 10))` is the string representation of the array created by `range(10, 101, 10)`. e.g. \"[10, 20, ..., 90, 100]\"\n* Keep the answer between 0~360 by using modulo operation\n* The returned answer will be always integer value"

The large population, economic growth, inheritance and constitutional provisions lead to the creation of a large universe of potential depositors. This creates an isolated selection problem. Hence, the interest will be very high among the institutions that will require cash from the depositors while following strict prudential rules. One of the options is to seek substantial equity injections. Therefore, considering that any kind of savings account will accumulate liquidity for the banks during this fever, an allocation of significant commercial capital in institutions is proposed. This money will be used to carry out investments with a small risk relative to the benefits to depositors and clearing price medium.\n"

During her tenure in the business, there has been an increase of shilling requirement for HRM's workforce. For her payroll department, Carmen is wondering at what rate her purchasing price for rumbas should be to account for the increase in demand from the workforce. To date, HRM has purchased rumbas at a cost of sh50,000 per year for purchasing operations. The company's workforce has grown substantially over the period and revenues from usage have increased by 30% compared to the previous price level. Given perfect equilibrium demand for the rumbas, the elasticity of the demand curve is, how many shillings per runtime should HRM pay for workforce?\n\nPlease generate a Python program to answer the given question.
