The software programmed by Perkins computes the average of each of the 200 resamples, then determines that the mean of these 200 resample means equals 0.0261. The program subtracts 0.0261 from each of the 200 resample means, squares each of these 200 differences, and totals up the squared differences, resulting in 0.835.
