Sometimes, the model would make errors during language identification. Therefore, Kaggle Keyboard only identifies the top five most probably target programming languages of the keyboard input. Specifically, Kaggle Keyboard is guaranteed to find the correct target programing languages for the following cases:\n* A single-language piece of code\n* A multiple-language piece of code with a single top probable space (ALLUNKNOWN)\n\nAs a user, you are expected to help Kaggle Keyboard to improve the accuracy of its results through providing a syntax highlighted version of the code you input in Kaggle Keyboard. For multiple-language pieces of code with more than one top probable space, users may use either the syntax highlighting functionality introduced in the \"Find Multiple Responses\" section or append individual parts to the code according to different programming languages that appear in the top-5 list (see the code snippet below).\n\nNote that the aforementioned languages are only recommended for the user's reference. Kaggle Keyboard does not guarantee the correctness of the obtained answers when users utilize non-top-probable spaces.\n\nSuppose the target keyboard input looks like the following, with the first underscore space start (\"an initial action\"), the second underscore space start (\"the action to compute everyone in\") and the third underscore space start (\"the type of action to return\") being the top probable spaces, as in this scenario, the start of the second&nbsp;scale&nbsp;and that of the fourth&nbsp;return\\(\\begin{bmatrix}\\*\\end{bmatrix}\\)=\\begin{bmatrix}\\*\\end{bmatrix}\\ **scale **are two different possible places where the user may append individual parts to the"

(Assume the Python default type is applied)\n\nPlease generate a Python program to answer the given question. When you finish the codes, please make sure you can run them on the editor.

These roads provide safe and fast interaction, but road overpasses and underpasses, although unattainable, often complicate the configuration of traffic and environmental problems. One of the most effective roads is a transit cable road. \n\nWe have the roads of a modern city with a complex road grid, as shown in the figure. You are required to display the shortest distances from each point to any other point on the road using Prim’s algorithm. To write a solution, you must first read the description of each program in the Excel study guide. Note that the distance between nodes of the graph is given in meters.\n\nSample Input:\nFirst, enter the number of rows and columns of the graph in the form:\n```python\n#num_rows\n#num_columns\nrow 1\nrow 2\n. . .\nrow ....\ncolumn 1\ncolumn 2\n. . .\ncolumn ....\n```\n\nAs mentioned in the Excel appendix, each row and column must be in the form of integers 1 to 20. The value of each cell in the input file is the optimal distance between nodes, and the value will be an integer such that the cell is empty.\n\nSample Output:\nYou must display the shortest distance for each item.\nThe following is an example of output sample where option -no_of_row -no_of_col indicates the \"input rows\" and \"input columns\":\nThe type of prime algorithm adapted form [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW3zXZ64jlI](https://www"

This sub-task starts from an existing Python program and a complete specification. You are also required to modify the Python program to render an output identical to the given specification. In this sub-task, you not only can observe the program being called, which is the case in the first sub-task, but can also see the source code of the program being called. Your mission is to continue writing a function makes the program run and gives output exactly identical to the given specification.\n\n#### Rules\n\n1. You are expected to create a function inside the unit test to continue writing the incomplete Python program and make it converge.\n2. You can use all forms of input and output, but they should be used in the way written in the specification. There are no restrictions on the input/output forms in your function.\n3.

Get answers of Python programs\n\nTo get answers, you need to run your Python programs. You can run them by executing the IPython Notebook with the interpreter speed option set to __10000__.\n> See more on getting started with IPython [here](https://github.com/acmilanmilan/kaggle-space-combat-a-reinforcement-learning-tournament/tree/master/python).\n\n\n**Example**:\nWe already got the question and the input, and prepared the Python programs. Assume the program is at the file __example.py__. To run this Python program on its input, you need to type the following in the notebook after opening it with the interpreter speed set to __10000__:\n```python\ntry:\n    from IPython.lib import parallel\n    print(\"Connected to the IPython client\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Connection to the IPython client failed\")\n\nprint(\"The code directory is: \", os.getcwd())\nexecute_problem_solving_via_ml('example.py')\n```\nAnd we expect __365/365 = 1__ as the expected output from this program.\n\n\n#### 6. Evaluate your program\n\nYou can get your program score by comparing it with the benchmark( expected output) created by a financial expert. \n\n**Example**:\n\nBelow you can find a blank python program. Your task is filling in a blank python code to get target results ( 365/365 = 1).\n\n0. Please type below python code in your current working directory and name it as __example.py__.\n\n    ```python\n    def solution():\n        # Define variable name and value\n        \n        # Do math calculation to get answer\n        \n        # return answer\n    ```\n\n"

But that's just one of the ten critical skills of the modern financial expert. Today your client is a broad range of corporate and institutional investors, and you must be able to synthesize and generate insights from a plethora of data, including financial statement data, non-financial and even unstructured data (such as social media sentiment). We need to encourage financial experts to acquire the necessary technology, data visualization, and data analytics skills to remain relevant and competitive. If you can generate insights from vast amounts of data, investors will high value your insight and opinion, and often pay you high retainers for your advice.\n\nTherefore, at the same time we are conducting job rotations challenges, we should encourage Institutional investors (committed to driving a considerable level of innovation) to also train the financial expert about advances in data analytics, technology and the fundamentals of data science to help drive investment decisions with visions, deliver reinvention and build robust cultures.\n\n## How to participate? \n\n### Retention assessment\n\nTo assess the level of retention for each investment, we will follow the specific recommendation from the [\"How efficient is the buy-and-hold strategy?

Researchers at EPFL wanted to know about public perceptions of online analytics for assessments in education. They turn to a COMEBOTS questionnaire and generate a scale to measure public attitudes towards online analytics. The survey covers a number of areas. These include concerns about privacy, as well as the risks connected with having access to someone’s analytic data. Would people accept, for instance, thousands of students acquiring a computer program that tracks their writing style as part of their annual assessment?\n\nThis run expands on the EPFL research design and runs a question treatment using more basic survey wording. Participants are given information to read. These are based on seven educational practices custom to education onlinee analytics. Participants then are asked to agree or not agree with five constructed statements. For all questions, participants first rated according to 5-point agreement scale before selecting the response.\n\nAfter the participants had completed the laboratory task, they were thanked and debriefed. GPAs were retrieved from school records on a packet of return on assessment days.\nPlease generate (clean) survey questions via scannable doc, cupcake.

The implementation is part of \"**When Bagging Meets Boosting**\" by [<NAME>](https://towardsdatascience.com/yet-another-bag-of-words-that-would-make-any-nlp-nerd-laugh-at-me-ba9601a042ba).\n\n```r\nrequire(caret)\nrequire(ggplot2)\ndata(\"creditcard\")\nsummary(creditcard$PostiveWord)\n```\n\n"

Calculating model weights\n\n***\n\nThe job of investment banks is to rebalance their hedging portfolios at certain intervals. Thus, you are expected to provide a Python program to calculate the weights on the following S&P 500 industry indices:\n* Communications\n* Energy\n* Financials\n* Healthcare\n* Industrial\n* Information Technology\n* Materials\n* Consumer Discretionary\n* Consumer Staples\n* Utilities\n\nThe Modified Value-at-Risk principle is used to perform the true rules-based portfolio rebalancing. The Monthly Expected Value of Future Loss (EVFL) Z-score of the ETPs daily returns should be calculated according to the following general equation:\n$$\nZ_{t,m+k} = \\frac{ \\bar{r}^2_{t,m} - \\bar{r}^2_{t,m+k} }{ \\bar{r}^2_{t,m"

For example, a private cloud provider might offer their services as follows: 1MB of data storage costs $1.50 per month. Upon storage, data is replicated in 3 data centers by the data vendor. The need to access (i.e., read) the stored data is as follows: (a) if there is no failure, access takes place to the data center with the latest copy of the data; (b) if there is a single failure in the 3 copies of the data, data access takes place relative on the highest copy available or to a copy relative simultaneously with performing a new data replication operation; (i.e., there is a new data write). In other words, the inconvenience (a 33% below full performance) resulting from a single failure is always assumed smaller than the 50% inconvenience resulting from a failure of the data center storing the latest copy of the data.\n\nQuestion: Given that the average recorded monthly data access is 8TB throughout the past 5 years from companies storing big data in this private cloud, is it justified, in either the short or long term, to provision extra storage in this cloud in order to avoid the occasion of scheduled data replication operations being performed to maintain data replication statistic of 3 copies?\n\nPlease generate a Python program to answer the given question.

They are linguists, 3D artists, Nobel Prize winners (for the discovery of Higgs boson), and any individual who uses and understands data in their line of work. In summary, Python allows us to write programs that are:\n* comply with the open source policy: this means that native Python programs is available to the public\n*  reusable programs that does the same thing over and over again\n*  readily available for the global society\n*  compatible\n*  open source\n*  highly customisable\n"

What actions might we make to convince him that we can be the ideal choice?\"\n\nQuestion: Considering \"Exhibits 1 and 2\" suggests your recommendation.\n\nWrite the **single** sentence as a paraphrase or a plain language from the above short quiz questions in the right column. In free text, you are required to consider \"Exhibits 1 and 2\" and write a recommendation letter to Sandeep about your suggestion ideas for his client Gennady.\n\nNotes:\n- Consider each item in a short quiz. Once you identify necessary ideas, you should make sure that you use paraphrasing to respond to the item.\n- CNN junk and CAPTCHA solutions can't help much in a mass paraphrasing. You can even use your own paraphrase capability (notice that you can use pre-trained models) or build a sentence paraphraser using neural networks.\n- It is crucial that you first set up a formulation about your suggestion, after that implement the sentence generation models including an encoder specifically for paraphrasing or use of an off-shelf encoder.\n\nYour output:\n```python\na = \"\"\"He said, \"I'd like to let Mr. Gennady in deciding to choose our business for his investment in corporate bonds.

Please check the grading policy below:\n\n* You will receive 0 point if your solution is not accepted by the system. Please make sure you can pass the automatic test before submitting the solution for grading.\n* Your final marker will run the cases not in the automatic test. So while preparing your code, you should try your best to come up with the most general case.\n* Each quesiton has a maximum of 10 marks. This means to receive 10 marks, you have to get 7.5 marks in computer grading and 2.5 from paper marking. However, we will assemble the scores of the three days together and no matter if you submit code or not, you can still get the maximum points in paper grading. For example, a student who receives the highest mark in computer grading on each of the three days can receive a maximum 75/75 (in three days) of computer grading, even if this scholar did not solve any question in paper."

In this case, it can only be a portfolio manager to take care of the third choice.\n\nA Python program/module that implements an algorithmic solution to the given problem and produces the right answer is a great start. However, this is only the first step towards a good solution.\n\n2. Readability/Formatting: It is important that your logic is readable and easily understandable. Remember that you are representing the financial industry. Given if there are multiple solutions, submitting a solution that is least readable (i.e. is difficult or time consuming to read, parse, interpret, or follow) will be rated lower compared to a solution that is more readable and easy to understand.\n3. Organisation: Ensure that all the elements of your program are organised, except in requirements that call for a succinct program that might have the elements mentioned above in one Python code line.\n4. Modularity: What usually makes code difficult to read is the inability for the reader to easily isolate, understand and work with relevant sections of code. Use classes, functions, local variables and other modularisation techniques available in Python. Import and use other modules, ask the assistance of others.\n5. Description: Be succinct, yet thoroughly describe your solution in the Discussion Board Question. Explain your logic, and tell readers WHY you came to the answer you did. Explain your thought process, which module you used and for what purpose, also tell us what learning points you have come across.\n6. Error Handling: Your program should handle runtime errors and any other reasonable errors that may occur during the logic execution.

The variable names are already defined are you don't need to do any definition. In this case you only need to do the math calculation:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    \n    # return answer\n```\n\nContinue output:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    lost = (28 * 10) / 60\n    answer = lost.to(\"%)\")\n    \n    # return answer\n    return answer\n```\n\nTherefore, if the neighborhood increases the membership fee by 10%, based on the data analyzed by the Python program generated by Chat GPT-4, the gym would lose around 7.3% of its incremental revenue."

Continuing this idea, we propose to check the accuracy of data based on three ways, including\n\n1. The logical consistency among values, e.g. relation between column `amount` and `quantity` for the transaction record rows.\n1. The existence of the canonical values or keywords that are frequently used to correct information in the original.\n1. The rules explicitly define by users to modify format or correct errors for the candidate key values.\n\nIn Spark DQ, we implement specialized internal statically program to defines these rules and exceptions, which sounds like the ability of computers to understand the natural language context. This capability provides a leap and flexibility to Spark DQ so that it can act differently between uniform datasets that always conform to the rules, and irregular datasets that contain thousands of records with a lot of erroneous data. The logical consistency of a dataset is also an important property of data to analyze. For example, given a pair of variables (e.g., `a`, and `b`) in a dataset that does not make sense (i.e, if `a` is available, must `b` be null), thus we can always consider the pair to be illogical.\n\n![framework](./img/LCRA_framework.png)\n\nOur proposed framework includes two steps: \n\n1. Data Correction. We extract, answer the query syntax, standard data query, and generate candidate key values.\n1. Data Verification. We evaluate the logical consistency of values, standard data check, compute the critical metrics.\n\nOur paper [1] can be found here.\n\n## References\n\n[1] <NAME>, <NAME>, <NAME"

Write a Python program to calculate the answer. The answer should be a `float` number with two decimal places.\n2. Weighted average cost of capital is calculated by the formula `WACC = WAD * R_D + WAP * R_P + WAE * R_E + WAI * R_I + WAO * R_O`, where W represents the weight of the respective item:\n   * Debt weighting\n   * Preferred stock weighting\n   * Common equity weighting\n   * Income tax weighting\n   * Operating profit weighting\n   * Asset financing\n\nExamples:\n\n* `WACC = 0.25 * 0.014 + 0.10 * 0.012 + 0.25 * (1 - 0.6) * 0.016 + 0.4 * 1.0 = 0.01272`\n* `WACC = 0.25 * 12% + 0.10 * 14% + 0.25 * (1 - 30%) * 16% + 0.40 * 100% = 4.95%`\n\n## Notes\n\n* Establish your Python program in the form of function.\n* The parameters of the function:\n\n    + No input parameters.\n\n    + Return a single value: answer (float).\n\n    + Do not return anything else extraneous. If two values need to be returned, it is recommended to use a custom tuple (`import copy`) or a custom object.\n\n    + Also, the name of the function should be `solution`.\n\n* Variable definition can be uesd as either:\n\n    + The global variable `global variable_name`.\n    \n    + The default value of the parameter `def fn(variable_name = x)`.\n    \n* Variable names should be simple and direct names that can be easily understood at a glance, e.g. `weighting1`, `cost_debt`.\n* The names of functions, classes, modules, etc. should follow"

Due to concerns of a potential default by E Corp, XYZ purchased a credit default swap (CDS) on E corp valued at $10 million with a designated coupon rate of 5%. After three months, E Corp goes bankrupt, resulting in a variety of activated CDS contracts. Consequently, XYZ examines the credit quality of the corporate bond they invested and the CDS's value on that bond. Here's some information on the current market status of E Corporation's bonds: Bond 1 is a 5-year senior unsecured bond trading at 40% of par, Bond 2 is a 10-year senior unsecured bond trading at 50% of par.

The number of subjects should be 100. The gender should include male and female; the gender introduces a pseudo random value between 0 (male) and 1 (female). In addition, the age should variate from 40 years to 70 years with a step size of 1 year. If the gender is \"male\", the weight should be randomly selected between 50 kg and 60 kg. In contrast, in case the gender is \"female\", the weight should be between 20 kg and 40 kg. On that basis, calculate the weight in kg per hand circumference (in cm). If the ID has even number, store the calculation into the new dataset \"*ID*\" + \"_edge\", otherwise \"*ID*\" + \"_inner\". Supposing the same person has been measured at the edge and the inner arm, subtract gready the difference of the results (Win: inner - edge). Before you calculate the standard error of tolerance, calculate the Win and the \"Error\" between the results Win and the result of \"ID\" + \"_inner\" from the dataset \"*ID*\" + \"_edge\". For your calculation you use Excel. Just start with a new Excel file that only contains ID, age, gender, edge, inner, Win and Error.

The average net fixed assets for TSM for the year were $12,200,000,000, and TSM generated $21,670,000,000 in revenue on average during the period. We can first calculate TSM’s fixed assets turnover ratio (FTA):\n\n![](/image/imgppy.png)\n\nThe FTA reflects revenue generated on average from the average net PP& E; in other words, it basically measures how efficiently TSM uses its net PP& E in the business operation. If TSM can utilize net PP& E efficiently, it means that the firm can use less net PP& E to generate revenue. For example, if TSM’s FTA is 20, that means TSM generated $20 in revenue for every $1 in net property, plant, and equipment that it has. On the other hand, if its FTA is 5, that means TSM generated only $5 of revenue for every $1 in net PP&E that it has on average.\n\nWe can also calculate the average return on TSM’s net PP&E. Remember, current ratio = Profit/Average -RF/Asset\\\nTR = Profit/Average -Asset/NetPP E  \nSo,   \nTR = 0.1247  \nAverage Return = TR/Average Assets ="

Her primary residence carries no mortgage and was recently valued at $2 million. She also owns a vacation property worth $3 million, with an outstanding mortgage of $1 million. Her defined-contribution pension plan has vested and is valued at $2.5 million. |\n| Aspirational Goals and Extended Liabilities | Everett is just beginning university and plans to pursue a medical degree. Lennon plans on paying for his entire education and living expenses as well as providing some assistance in funding his future practice. She believes that these goals will be covered with $1.5 million in present value terms. She has begun the process of setting up a special needs trust to provide lifetime benefits for Marshall that will not interfere with the government benefits that he is eligible to receive. It will be funded with $2 million within the year. She recently received an honorary doctorate from her alma mater and has started the process of endowing a chair in its communications department.

Generating PINs (Chapter 17)<a name=\"answer_chapter_17\"></a>\n\nWhen using a debit or credit card, you might see some digits that need to be entered for verification. This is what is called by Personal Identification Number (PIN). Different services might have different requirements on the PINs, such as one of its digits is even or odd, or its first or second digit is odd or even, etc.  \n\nIn this exercise, you will develop a financial program that generates 4-digit PINs accordingly to the required conditions. You need to generate a list of 16 (i.e. 4 * 4) PINs that satisfy all the conditions at the same time. The conditions are given below:\n\n- `first digit is even`\n- `second digit is odd`\n- `third digit is even or odd`\n- `the sum of the PIN is odd`\n\nFor example, an acceptable list is `[\"0227\",\"0245\",\"0249\",\"0261\"......]`. The expected result is according to the following logic _[first digit](“even”) -> [second digit](“odd”) -> [third digit](“even or odd”) -> [the sum of the PIN](“odd”)_\n\nYour program can be written like this:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # the logic of your program\n    \n    # the way you want to generate PINs\n    \n    # Return the list of generated PINs\n    return {random_generated_PINs}\n```\n\nTry other PIN generation logic by changing [1st digit](“even”), [2nd digit](“odd”), [3rd digit](“even or odd”), and [the sum of the PIN](“odd”) to meet the requirement of `[1st digit](“odd or even”) -> [2nd digit](“even”) -> [3rd digit](“odd”) -> [the sum of the PIN](“odd or even”)`\n\n\n#### 5.

The rate is good for up to 1 week. If not paid in 1 week, the borrower will pay 6% interest for the outstanding amount or pay a finance charge (Hint: Investopedia’s explanation for how finance charge is calculated might be helpful). Finance charge on past-due balance does not reset upon payment. For example, if you have a $500 loan due on August 31, the finance charge is $7.50 (3 openings * $2.50). If paid on September 1, the finance charge is $7.50.

In the coding platform we use `PyExec`, memory allocations are done automatically to fit the needs of the program. In plain language, the memory is automatically fit to the size of the variables holding the data. \n\nFor example, in the problem posed above, the three variables stated have the following sizes:\n```\nnominal_rate = 0.05\nspot_rate_1 = 0.04\nspot_rate_2 = 0.045\n\n```\nBecause they have no greater length than 5 digits, the program fits the memory modules to accomidate the five character long variables, signes and all. Sometimes, however we may ask the program to fix the module to a size, or length, that would exceed the requirments of the program. You can see that type of problem below.\n\nTo terminate your program, you can print the following on the screen.\n```\nTitle_Of_Your_Question = A\nTitle_Of_Your_Question = B\nTitle_Of_Your_Question = C\nTitle_Of_Your_Question = D\n...\n```\n\nHere's another look at the problem stated above in the form of a question:\n\nQuestion: With everything taken into consideration, Golden Eggs have brought you a net income of $600,000. What can you conclude?\n\nPlease generate a Python program to answer the given question. The format of the program should be the following:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    "

Besides the immediate output results from the submitted code, multiple cases are defined for each question to test your input design, runtime, and the reliability of the solution. You can design your case input and view the candidate's solution with test cases by checking the entire submission.\n\n### Runtime test\n\nThe testing process is conducted by a benchmarked timer to measure the runtime of the code. After removing the judgement time and other internal work of the arrange, a message will be sent to the candidate explicitly stating the runtime of the code (in seconds). We deliberately use another dimension to provide further transparency on the performance of the code. Here is the comparison of an optimal and an overcomplex Python code submitted:\n\n> Table 2: Runtime (in seconds) tool used in dioxide\n|     Result   | An answer with an optimal Python solution (second)  | A solution with an       over-complication Python logic (second) |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Runtime info | 'Code validated in 1 second' | 'Code validated in 1096 seconds' |\n\nWe encourage our candidate to submit a Python code that can be differentiated from others in focus and clarity. An optimal solution can achieve higher performance than any other complex one without compromising in logic and results.\n\n### Error-test case\n\nQTEST sets provided all valid and invalid input cases. Then a framework suite is conducting a 'looping' task to test if every case can lead to an expected output or not. This process will point out any error in the actual output.

Management has decided to proceed with the increased plant capacity; however, the actual new equipment expenses are less than planned, and the new building is not required. Furthermore, management has decided to use all free cash flow to pay dividends to stockholders rather than building a new facility. These actions will have an impact on the total dollar value of capital expenditure in 2019 and free cash flow in subsequent years.\n\nManagement’s choice for the 2019 capital budget led the Chief Financial Officer to expect a zero free cash flow in 2019. The primary reason for the $900,000 loss in free cash flow was the planned building of a new facility in 2019 for $1,000,000. This facility will be required to facilitate the sales increase suggested in the 2019 sales forecast. While the company does not yet possess a binding commitment to purchase equipment in 2019, the finance committee is forecasting it will spend $500,000 on new capital equipment in 2019 if this equipment is available.\n\nThe company has $6,000,000 in cash reserves and expects to borrow $600,000 in 2019 to cover operational budget shortfalls.

The kinds of fees investment firms charge their customers are diverse, but generally fall into two major classifications: management fees and performance fees. Actual clients pay their service expenses as a percentage of the total value of overall assets under management. A typical money management business' basic compensation revolves around a formula that combines due diligence, self-assessment and steady communication with leaders. Internal process; external services; and; management fees, expense allocations, opportunities, priorities and challenges were not clearly articulated. Managers have demonstrated an unfailing ability over the last several decades to discover new customers to charge huge management fees.\n\n## Tags\n- [Python 2](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/python-2)\n- [Financial](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/python-2/financial)\n- [Python 3](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/python-3)\n- [Financial](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/python-3/financial)\n- [C++](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/c)\n- [Financial](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/9799/c/financial)\n- [Java](https://www.codingame.com"

Your project must demonstrate good practices:\n```\n```- Define functions: Functions will help to make the project well organized. They enable other developers and keep indentations which help to indent clearly with functionality.\n```\n```- Use pep8 standard:  In general, there are many standards for code. There is the Common Lisp standard of code, there is the Java standard, there is the Python 2.6 standard, etc. Evidently, a certain project must follow a certain standard to avoid mess and simplify productivity. The Python 3.6+ community uses PEP 8 as their standard. There are then you should format your project to fit with this. But you can also use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) if you want to make a utopian code. \n```\n```- Use object-oriented programming: OOP is the popular programming structure and it helps to achieve reuse and adaptability better than the others.

Textbooks have been re-written, revised, updated, and recycled many times over and no young mind has ever begun a finance career without assignments from one textbook or another laying out her classroom principles.\n\nWhile Professor Modigliani passed away in 2010, her legendary contributions have continued to impact the field long after her ride.\n\nCurrent teaching methods still include in Lesson 1 the three tenets for what it means to be a good scientist (Her investment)\n> (DUTY) 1. Be genuinely interested in the problem you have set for yourself.\n\n> (DUTY) 2. Do not forget the main objective of the real problem and the current state of knowledge.\n\n> (DUTY) 3. Be honest in your work, and understand the methods used in the results.\n>Test answers objectively respond to these points. No student fails in a textbook, but instructors often seem unable to appropriately reward those who would earn perfect grades under Professor Modigliani's eyes, if she were still with us. Students must perform well in order to succeed in a competitive industry. It is our duty, as a financial community, to bring life back to the classroom.\n\n\nThe rest of the lessons she imparted can be found at:\n\nLesson 2, Frameworks as research value, Lecture 1.\n\nLesson 3, Reverse Direction of Desirable Use, Lecture 2.\n\nLesson 4, The “else” in Boolean, Lecture 3 and Summary (recommended)\n\nhttps://github.com/modigolian/S521-F18-Modigolian\n\n\nData Description:https://github.com/modigolian/S521-S18-Data\n\n\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to check out our open forum.\nIf you have general questions about finding your way around NEU classes, or"

It has been deployed as a backend technology of various on-demand question-answering online systems. It finds appropriate rule templates and automatically fills slots, such as numbers, variables, operator names, etc.. Besides, it analyses inputs to find the contextual template set that every sub segment of the sentence typically conforms to, hence ultimately returning the desired rule most suitable for the given context. The model is trained based on a grammar-derived dataset that resembles a QA database whose format is similar to [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Response_Set), retrieved from past exams.\n\nEspecially for Math syntax parsing, we use an efficient [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) approach, as numbers can be easily placed into the rules in their natural order.\n\nFor example, we may use ''the ratio $8:x$ of 8 and $y$ is $3:4$'' as the input and parse as:\n```python\nRatioOf(8, [8, y]) = 3:4\n```\n\n<br />\n\n![rqf](../../img/rqf.png)\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n#### Technical & Mathematical Properties\n\n<br />\n\n1.

Sample space is not large either.\"Learner can not really learn the grammar of python if there is not sufficient amount of correct programs(the way humans do).

Time-consuming. It takes a long time to generate a large amount of python programs, and the precision is not high.\n\n\n\n\n## Future Directions\nMain Future Direction: Include more features in consideration of pattern recognition. \n\nFuture Directions to bring the precision up: may be the accuracy can be lifted by collecting a bigger data set and using more sampling techniques to collect generative samples in order to balance the relationship between the generated program set"

For instance, as opposed to five variables used in the previous problem, there can be as few as one variable involved. Because of that, the separation of the header line in this hand-written variant introduces padding in the output. This could be alleviated by using a blank line between the variables and the awake part of the Python program. The columns do not need justifying because many solutions do not divide into evenly into the problem's columns. Examples of these questions are:\n```\nThe cost of energy consumed by a guitar amplifier in Watts would be approximately (16 * 10000) / (number of hours I used the amplifier) euros\n----> The cost of energy consumed by an 16 Watts guitar amplifier is approximate 29 per hour\n```\n\nPointer: Please only output relevant python statement rather than all possible Python expressions that will reach the same answer. Because, this might introduce irrelevant expressions into the generated Python program.\nOther examples could be considered by your fancyness ;)\n\n## Problem: Generate Final Output\nIn the above problem, there are some blank spaces in the header line, this is sufficient for the user to generate the problem without"

The important thing to note here is that there are some inputs which act as constants whereas others are variables, which requires the author of this program to do a lot of thinking before coming up with a possible solution. \n\n> Also, it’s not that easy to find these numbers as they are used for comparison to find a particular percentage. Once the program is done, it evaluates mimicking a real complex algorithm that has been simplified on purpose. The output here is 60.61% which represents the percentage of a scam transaction among all the flagged ones. So, it’ll be great to see a program doing it.\n\n> The task is not only about programming but also requires some new skills such as reading instructions, mathematical skills, logical skills, and so on. A programmer is expected to master"

A list of five stocks will be picked up as the universe of stocks for the implementation. Your implementation function has to consider the capital allocation, rebalancing, exposure and the leverage that is provided by a margin account.\n\nNo programming solution is expected to be submitted in this part. The compilation and execution of all participants' codes will be done by the online judge in order to identify only the best performer. All participants will be ranked according to their performance, and the winner is the person who achieves the highest return among all entries within the 30-minute window allocated to define a trading strategy and 30 minute allocated for the execution of the trading strategy.\n\n### MIT-Adaptive strategy\n\nHere, the reference implementation of a strategy is \"the MIT-Adaptive portfolio strategy\", which is described below and originated in the Stanford CS229 Fall 2019 course. \n\nThe portfolio strategy considers the following two steps: The capital allocation strategy and the rebalancing strategy.\n\nThe capital allocation strategy divides financial assets between individual stocks and cash to take advantage of the wide variety of opportunities in the global capital markets. The allocation between stocks and cash considers 1. Similarity Score of a stock portfolio to market portfolio and stocks' volatility. The goal of the capital allocation strategy is to improve the overall portfolio'"

It is a measure comparing current assets to current liabilities. The higher the ratio the easier it will be for a company to pay short term and long term debt. The lower the ratio the more likely will the business go bankrupt. Fortunately for the business that incorporates use this ratio to develop strategies in order to ensure it does competent business.\n\n----------------------> Current assets contained in Accounts Payable. \nAccounts payable is a current liability. Increases in accounts payable means the company has more money to spend! BUT Not good because the company is buying more supplies on credit overtime which could mean falling behind financially or bankruptcy. Decreases in accounts payable do not necessarily mean the companys finances are improving and therefore no change in the current ratio. \n----------------------> Cash held in bank account\nIf the company has more cash, it means that a company is able to pay off short term debts and adjsut to changes in their business easily. Working with more cash enables the company to react quickly. Cash is usually not stored for a finaly purpose and should be used to react and balance. If the company has more cash rather than a bank account, it means the companys finances are improving. But this may also mean the company is not investing enough, not expanding, and just sitting still.\n----------------------> Customer balance\nIf the company is growing then they are cleaning up more customer balances which means that the company finances are improving and the company has ability to pay off short term debts and adjsut to changes in their business easily. The increase and decrease would also happen from bankruptcy which is not something good.\n----------------------> Increased balances in Inventories\nNow this is a tricky one. From the definition we know they are a current asset, which is them minuses"

Each bank is staffed with 1 to 2 trainers and up to 16 loan officers. The typical Training Path includes 3 cycles as defines in (Table 7: Training Path for OO23 Bank Years 2) with a 2 weeks ramp-up. Training Paths should include a 2 week ramp-up with 4 CRC's work cycles each.  On average there are 6 calls per trainer per hour with 2 minutes of conversation on each call. Assume trainers will process and fund loans as well unbilled times (training, team meetings, etc..). Calls answered are 66% of calls begun, which is claimed to be the average for all Persist開Zero Bank call handling. Timeliness for control loans is defined by time in-silo (from end of call to beginning of funding).\n\nThe US population will stand at 304,139,504 in 2010, growing to 311,960,363 in 2013.
