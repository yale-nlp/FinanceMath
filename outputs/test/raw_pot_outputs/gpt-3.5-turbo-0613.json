Conservative Fund's returns are usually distributed with an average of 3% and a standard deviation of 7%. As for Assertive Fund, its returns follow a normal distribution with an average of 7% and a standard deviation of 15%. The top executives have tasked a financial analyst to calculate the possibility that the returns on the merged portfolio might surpass 26%. Given that the returns on both funds don't influence each other, how would the analyst estimate the chances of the returns on the merged fund exceeding 26%?",

We need to find the odds of maximum one default, i.e., P(0; 4) + P(1; 4).\nUsing the Poisson distribution equation, we calculate the probability of 0 defaults P(0; 4) as exp(-4) * 4^0 / 0! = e^(-4).\nSimilarly, the probability of 1 default P(1; 4) is exp(-4) * 4^1 / 1! = 4 * e^(-4).\nTherefore, the odds of maximum one default is e^(-4) + 4 * e^(-4).\nWe calculate this using the `math` module in Python and return the answer."

After examining the footnotes in LoveYourHome's financial report, Sam identifies a nonrecurring profit of $2 per share and a one-time restructuring cost of $3 per share, stemming from an acquisition in the previous year. Utilising a top-down analysis approach, Sam projects that LoveYourHome's basic EPS will rise to 76 in the upcoming year. The company's current share price is $72.
