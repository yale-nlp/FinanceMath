($GDR=\\frac{GD}{1+GD rapport Bien})where $GD is Geometric Development and rapport Bien is the inflation rate. How can we get the Geometric Development? It is given in the table. So we have all the things just give the answer in your final sentence.\n\nYour Answer:\nA researcher identifies 2.2 for the economic real return\n\n\n\n1/ What is the input of this question ?\n\nThe input of the question is the percentage of the Geometric Rate of Return.\n\n2/ Does the table db schema follow the \"norm\" of the 1NF ? Why ? \n-The table db schema is following the \"norm\" of the 1NF : \"One attribute=one field=one value\". In the other hand it is the \"definition\" of the \"first normal form\" ... if it's not following that, then it's not in 1NF.\n\n3/ Does the table contain the \"key\" like defined here ? why ?\n-The table contain the key : yes it is the first table column \"GeometricReturn\", so the table has a key... .\n\n4/ Will you create any other tables than this base table ?\n\nMaybe you will create another one to store the answer, with another 1 column, the answer's key, and one answer's field. (Think to create a relation table if necessary) \n\nExplanation: if the answer could be held by mystery, an other table couldn't be necessary (But maybe ...  error, details, ...). So the relation table seems useless (only one \"logical\" relation possible here).\n\nHow many dimension ?\nThis table has 1 Dimension because there is one main theme. Two tables : one to store the answers and one to store the information about the geometry rate of return.\n\n5/ If we want to add any index, what kind of index would you use ?\nI Don't think indexes are necessary here ... unless you want to improve performance. \nthe table make reference of two \"dimensions\" :\n\n-The first dimension is a table that store only one value. It would be convenient to use a ClusterIndex to monitor the entry, The database manager could use"

The cost of depreciation if the asset were used for financial reporting, which is given on the assumption of straight-line depreciation over 10 years, which means every year, the asset will cost 10/10*1,000,000=100,000. Therefore, the annual cost of depreciation is 100,000$, given the question's assumption straight-line depreciation.\n\n3. The cost of depreciation if the asset were used for tax reporting, which is given on the assumption of three-year MACRS depreciation. The three-year rate is 0.333, therefore the first-year rate is 0.333*1,000,000=333,333\\$.\n\nTherefore, the tax benefit of the asset acquisition is:\n(333,333 - 100,000) = 233,333.\nStep 2: Alpha Enterprises' deferred tax liability is the difference between their full tax liability and their current tax liability, where the current tax liability is what has been paid to date. On January 1, 2002, Alpha Enterprises' deferred tax liability is 0, i.e. they have not yet earned a profit. Further assuming that their tax rate is 40% (and they are in the 40% tax bracket), we need to add the tax benefit of the asset acquisition to the deferred tax liability. This is a simplified calculation.\n\nTherefore, Alpha Enterprise's deferred tax liability is:\n0 + 233,333 = 233,333.\nStep 3: To answer the question, you will need to add the deferred tax liability in step 2. So the answer is:\n233,333.\n\nStatement: Therefore, the answer is 233,333."

We are asked about what will be the time weighted rate of return. \nTo answer that we need to know that what is time weighted return. As per financial dictionary, time-weighted return is a method to determine the average return on an investment by weighing each return by the amount of time it represents.\nSo in our case we know the fund is invested in $500 in year 1, the return is 12%,so taking 1 year as unit time the 12% of return would be  12/1 = $12 (as $100=100%)\nSimilarly in year 2, the return is 5%, so taking 2 year as unit time the 5% of return would be 5/2 = $2.5 (as $100=100%)\nAnd in year 3, the return is 1%, so taking 3 year as unit time the 1% of return would be 1/3 = $0.33(as $100=100%)\nNow to get the total return we need to find the sum of return for each year for that we add the return to get Total return. i.e.\n$12(Y1) +  $2.5(Y2)+ $0.33 (Y3) = $14.83 \ntherefore total time weighted return is $14.83.\n\nFormal Clause: What will be the time-weighted rate of return?\n\nTherefore, the answer is $14.83."

What would the formula or method of finding which day you need in order to find the accrued interest? Thank you for your help! I hope the prompt is reasonable. : )\n\nComment: I was thinking that procedure I would follow would go as follows:\n\nIf the month of the issue date is 5 or 6, then subtract the issue date's day from 30, and then whatever exceeds that number will be the accrued interest.\ne.g, June 2, coupon date would yield 222 accrued days. Thus, 222 - 2 = 220 and 220 x 3 / 360 = 7.67. I can then multiply this value 7.67 by 2 because coupon interest is interest for the 5th and 10th of April. So it is 15.34x 100 = 1534 or1,534.00\nIf the month of the issue date is 7, 8, or 9, then add the issue date's day to 31, and then whatever exceeds that number will be the accrued interest.E.g. June 2: 31 + 2 = 33. so 92 accrued days....\n\nComment: But having said that, I'm not sure if we are supposed to consider if there is an issue date. I'm asking because my teacher asked me to get the accrued interest as of June 5th, not with respect to the publication date, January 3, which yield a different answer, than 213...\n\nComment: So for this method, because the coupon issues on the 5th:\n5th of April would yield 87.87. and because March has 31 days, we would add 2\n= 89 total days.\n79/360 x 100 would be 22.22 x 100 = 2224, where 2224x 2 coupon interest would yeild $ 4,44"

            " The stock price of Company H surged by 2.5 times its initial price during the same period last year and question is what was the continuously compounded return on the company's stock price. To answer this, first we need to know what is continuously compounded return?\n\nContinuously Compounded Return (CCR) is an annualized figure which is derived by taking exponentiation of the rate per observation period or time interval. Calculation of CCR is based on daily closing prices instead of historical price figure recorded only before closing. The daily dividends received during an accounting period are not a part of the calculation.\n\nThe formula for CCR is CP_final / CP_initial * (1 / Time Period) with respect to t\n\nwhere CP_final = value of stock at the end of the accounting period\nCP_initial = value of stock at the beginning of the accounting period\nTime Period = length of the accounting period\n%x of period = portion of period since the beginning\n\nCCR on the continuously basis, t = 1 / Time Period * CCR(1 %x of period)\n\nTherefore CCR(1%x of period) = CP_final / CP_initial * (1 / %x of period) with respect to year\n\nAlso, by regarding that the use of the symbol CF = f(t) (analogously CP, PL) we have\n\nThe CF (continuous iussaquin return) of CF_tm1, tm1 CF_tm2, …, CF = n CF is denoted as CF_D_n for CF(0+) = CF_0\n\nCF discrete iussaquin return at time period 1 (closed between CF_1 and CF_2) is CF_2 / CF_1 - 1\nIn today's paper we say the original price of Company H in last year is ${CP_0}$. At the end of the period last year, the price was ${CP_f}$.\n\nThe stock price of Company H surged by ${Ktimes}$ its initial price and you want to find the continuously compounded return on the company's stock price last year. You need to know the final and initial value of the price. By using the formula above, you can closely find the answer.

Because it has already received some return due to the discount, it can no longer be placed at par. It receives more return because the market rate after one year has fallen.\nFor this reason, the cash flows at the beginning of the next year must simply be devalued accordingly by dividing them by the market yield in the SOFR method.\nIf one pays only a return of 7% during the second year, 1.07"

In the table above, each recovery point has two corresponding probabilities, one from scenario 1, and the other from scenario 2. We can join these two probabilities into one probability of the projected recovery. (Find how to convert them into expected numbers.)\n\nAs you can see, every probability in the table is either 40 or 60.

Therefore let's divide 80, 60, 90, 10 by 100.\n\nStep 3: Sum the probabilities after step 2 and recalculate the probability percentage. For example, let's find the probabilities of the scenarios in the table above.\n40 / 2 = 20%\n40 + 20 = 60%\n60 / 2 = 30%\n60 + 30 = 90%\n90 / 2 = 45%\n45% - 60% = 25%\n50 / 2 = 25%\n\nStep 4: Repeat Step 3 for the anticipated recovery as the coverage increases to the other scenario.

Since there were 2,100,000 shares outstanding pre-options due to be vested, and the net income post-preferred dividends was $11,200,000, the reported earnings per share are:\n\nEarnings per share (continuing) = net income post-preferred dividends / Total shares outstanding = $11,200,000 / 2,100,000 = $5.38/share\n\nSince there was only 1 full cycle of options vesting during this one year, Step 4 is where we first really start discussing dilutfied earnings.

            " The financial product bought by the buyer is an annual coupon bond, which means each year, the buyer receives an interest of 8% of the initial investment, which is approximately $213.60. Therefore, the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is 8%.\n\nThe coupon rate is 8% / 1 = 0.08\nThe APY is 1 + r = 1 + 0.08 = 1.08\nAssuming the coupon is compounded annually, there are 20 years left until maturity.\nIf the buyer sells the bond after exactly eight years, he/she will get the investment back. In eight years, the investment received 8% interest eight years, which is approximately $213.60. In the remaining 12 years, the interest received is approximately $1812.48 (1.08^12 x 213.60).\nThe investment horizon spans eight years, so the time to maturity for the investor is 12 years. The modified duration is 8 years as well. Therefore, there is no duration gap at the moment of acquisition. The answer is zero.\nTherefore, the answer is 0\n\nQuestion: Teacher Alice has a patchwork quilt made by 200 squares whose sides are either colored red, green, blue, yellow, purple, or orange.

            " First, we should find the enduring cost, which is the average cost plus the marginal cost. According to the instructions, the enduring cost is 256/Q + 2 + 4Q2 + 2 + 8Q2 = 256/Q + 2 + 12Q2. If you look back to the question, the enduring cost for one corporation is different from the others, 256 + 2Q +  4Q2 = 256 + 2Q +  2Q2. Nevertheless, the net effect of the aggregate enduring cost is the same as the net effect one corporation's enduring cost. For another aspect, we can see that if the average value for each corporation is T = 62q = 258 > P = 93 – 1.5Q > T = 62Q = 256, competition extends over the entire range of QQ from 6262. In other words, QQ will reach 6262 if the corporation enters the market with a long-run fixed cost of 258, and the overall fixed cost will be 258(1 + 10Q/62) = 256(1 + 50Q /62). Therefore, the profit of the firm is 93 – 1.5Q – 256/Q – 2 – 12Q2 = 0.25Q2 – 91.5Q + 93. However, the equation can be written as 0.25(Q – 62)(Q - 4.5) = 0, which implies that Qq = 62Q = 4.5, which is the entry point for a corporation with a long-run average fixed cost of 258.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 91.53.\n\nUsing this template we've provided will ensure accuracy and speed.

For such a case, we can use the single attribute model in the forward checking. \n\nModify 0 constant of the attribute to a small number that can be considered as equality for numerical reasons, then we can use multiple attributes model. If the justifiability is 100, we can keep the perturb as constant 55 as it is. Otherwise, if the justifiability is near to 0 which means our guess does not resemble the truth, we can change 55 to another value, say 1000.\n\nNow let's check the value of varHMBase (harmonic mean for perturbed object) is positive or negative in comparison to varHMBase (harmonic mean for original object):\nIf positive, do nothing, we can continue using the original security 1;\nIf negative, we will perturb values of the variables according to the domain of the variable.\n\nRemember, if rewards of backward checking are higher than that of forward checking, we need to give up the backward checking and discard the perturb stuff to the origin.

Current protection accumulates over time until it reaches $ 85 million since SPE is special purpose entity and utilizing its own funding to pay as much as possible from defaulted assets.

            "\n\nStep 1:\nYou saw Common Stock as an item in the Calculation section on the horizontal axis of the equity section at the top of the page. The calculation is the centrifugal force. If you select 'Calculation' section, you will see the marginal increase in such a case. Unlike the case of Common Stock, the centrifugal force is not included in any of Preserved Profits, Accumulated Retained Earnings and Retained Profits. To address this issue, we may assume Common Stock, Preserved Profits, Accumulated Retained Earnings and Retained Profits as different accounts, though they are different from Common Stock. As the account Preserved Profits is created with the retained earnings at a subsequent point of time, it stands to reason that Preserved Profits-Suspense will be created for the period at which Profits are accrued due to the current year's EBIT which will be realized later. This step, thus, forms the centrifugal force to be utilized for when Short-term Loans, Long-term Loans and Dividends are created. So, the context would be: 235,842, 345,564, 299,145<.\n\nStep 2:\nTotal equity to be provided by shareholders = Common Stock - Long-term loans + Dividend.\n\nStep 3:\nThe sum of Long-term loans is a stockholder's invested amount, so if we use a vector JxM, it can be expressed as 235,842, 345,564, 235,842.

Calculating \"daily loss based on risk parameters\" as mentioned at the end of part (A) of the quiz may result in a loss that is higher than the related 99% VaR.

Yeah, but first, we need to find the future value function.\nLet's see...\nfuture_value\t= payment * (1 + interest)^x\nThe function accepts three arguments: the payment per annul, the interest rate per annum, and the the number of years. we should be able to grab these real quick from the pay table and match this amusing bonus. One thing I don't like is the idea of having to own these transactions. Instead we could construct a freely available payment table. in this scenario, we can create a function that will accept the whole table and let's have fun. What are we waiting for? We are forgetting something notable. This is a calculation of a net worth in the far future It is possible that the world may come to end and stop paying attention to payments . along these lines, we need to close the table. But before that, it is risky. We need to consider whether it has been paid out\nto accommodate for this failure. The more generous members would think it wise to call this extra contribution a \" safety margin.\". The reason this is not a separate variable is that it is conceded from the payment table. Now, since this is meant to be a future measure, I believe it is calculated with interest. The amount at the top will benefit more from the interest than previously paid contributions. I propose we calculate it but keep it separate from the payment in the table for the purposes of the net calculation. In conclusion, I think the future value table ought to have four columns: the payment year, the payment amount, the future value per annum as of that year, and the safety margin. The table must be clean of successfully invested assets.

If these two items are shown in the balance sheet, let's calculate the value of liabilities-equity ratio in our previous example. It would help a lot since we could deduce the percentage of total liabilities represented on the balance sheet based on the ratio.\n\nStep 2: develop a formula for calculating total common-size liabilities. Note that the common-size calculation first requires that each balance sheet item is expressed as a percentage of its numerical principal. This step helps to equate different items, thus allowing the ratios of common-size equivalent balance sheet items to be directly compared. We can easily express the liabilities as a fraction of its numerical principal: Total liabilities / Total stockholders’ equity = x/1. Once we divide by Total stockholders’ equity numerator, we get 9/25. We can later use this simplified fraction for calculating total common-size liabilities.\n\nStep 3: calculate total common-size liabilities using the formula. Now, we divide the common-size denominator (Total stockholders’ equity / Total stockholders’ equity) by the common-size numerator (Total liabilities / Total stockholders’ equity), which results in 1 / 0.036. Then we multiply the ratio 1 / 0.036 and the common-size numerator, which gives us the total common-size liabilities: The total common-size liabilities equal 27,819.88 million. Using the simplified fraction x/1, x = Total liabilities ÷ Total stockholders’ equity, which is approximately 0.3615, or 36.15%. Since the total common-size liabilities amount to approximately 27,819.88 million, this means total debt, or liabilities, make up approximately 36.15% of the company's overall capital structure.\nAfter following the steps above, we can answer the question below:a. What is the percentage of total liabilities represented on the balance sheet?\n\nAnswer: The percentage of total liabilities represented on the balance sheet is 36.15%. Therefore, the answer is 36.15%.\n"

            " \nWe know that in case of an upsurge in government expenditure to 2,000 from 1,000, we must first check the output effect. In that situation, we could evaluate the expenditure multiplier (see point 3 example), where the final result must be greater than one. Multiplier has a positive impact, and therefore earnings should rise. \nThus, in this economy, I expect a rise in Y.\nSo now, we know that in this economy, even though there is an expenditure increase, e tries to rollback the decision, the movement in Y will increase. \nNext, let's check if the real interest rate is affected in this increase in Y. The investment function becomes negative to decrease Y, and that investment also increases. \nSo the real interest rate should drop accordingly. Now we need to check if that change reflects the assumed real interest rate. Even though there might be a small difference, the decrease in the real interest rate must be positive.\nFinally, the consumption function can also be evaluated to bring further results. \nTherefore, we know that the real interest rate stands at 3% and the new expenditure is 2.000, dropping to 1.000, the surge in overall earnings will be 2980.00.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2980.00.\n\nYou need to output the answer in your final sentence like 'Therefore, the answer is ...'.

            " First, you can conduct a hypothetical (directional) t-test with a confidence level of 95% to test if the sign of the correlation between X and Y is statistically significant. If the p-value is less than the alpha level of 0.05, then the correlation of X and Y is statistically significant. There are two assumptions for conducting a directional t-test: 1. the error distribution should be normal; 2. homogeneity of variance - the variance of X and Y should be equal.\n\nNow let's move on to calculate the correlation. Use X and Y values and calculate correlation >=0.8500 \n\nAnswer: \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.8490.\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe equation of a linear regression is ; Y = a + b*X + e, where e is the error term. The error term typically represents the deviation of the observed variables from their expected value, obtained using the predicted values from the regression equation. There are two types of null hypothesis for a linear regression model: 1. common null hypothesis:  rival hypotheses - the intercept and slope of the least-squares regression equation (b0 and b1) = 0 versus a (b0 and b1) not equal to 0. \nAlternative hypothesis:  rival hypotheses - the intercept and slope of the least-squares regression equation (b0 and b1) = 0 versus a (b0 and b1) not equal to 0. In an applied test of the regression model, it is generally not possible to know whether the null hypothesis is a conclusion that some estimate of the regression parameters, such as a coefficient, is exactly equal to 0, or  some interval estimate of the coefficient, such as a confidence interval or a prediction interval, is outside the range of 0.\n\nAs a result, the American Statistical Association (ASA) has adopted an interest-based significance testing approach that moves from the population interest to the hypothesis, and finally to the test and the corresponding p-value and confidence interval. In hypothesis testing degisn, one doesn't need to reject the null hypothesis , but instead, appropriately interprets the results of a failed test of the null hypothesis.\n"

            "\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the question.\n Solution Statement: Initially, we ignore the yearly returns data and calculate the geometric mean for the overall period. Since an investment is worth 100 at the start, we get the distribution of returns as follows:\n (1+x1)*(1+x2)*(1+x3)*(1+x4)*(1+x5)=102.90\n Since this large formula expression is difficult to solve, we want to simplify it so we can focus on the list of returns. The geometric property is such that the multiplication of all of the value returns is equal to the product of the individual value returns raised by their associated powers. Adjusting this, we see the raised formula looks like the following, showing that the arithmetic mean of the returns is used on both sides of the equation:\n </p>\n <p>\n (1+x1)<sup>1/5</sup>*(1+x2)<sup>1/5</sup>*(1+x3)<sup>1/5</sup>*(1+x4)<sup>1/5</sup>*(1+x5)<sup>1/5</sup> = 100\n Using the relationship of the geometric to the arithmetic mean, this gathers to this:\n </p>\n <p>\n (1+x1)/5*(1+x2)/5*(1+x3)/5*(1+x4)/5*(1+x5)/5 = 100\n Isolating x1:\n </p>\n<p>\n Solution Statement:  To finish, we just need to isolate x1. Using algebra, we can divide everything by (1/5):\n (1+x1)/(1+x2)/(1+x3)/(1+x4)/(1+x5)=100\n For simplicity, let's divide all quantities by 100:\n (1/100)<sup>5</sup>(1+x1)/(1+x2)/(1+x3)/(1+x4)/(1+x5)=1\n With these additional parentheses, we can raise everything to the 1/5 power:\n</p>\n\n <p>\n"

Calculate the standard deviation of a return\nRemember that Weekly Return has a standard deviation and is following a normal distribution. The option will allow you to choose the central tendency and generate an appropriate Q-Q plot automatically. Then choose Mean-Std based on a Normal distribution: N(mean, std).\n\n3. Calculate the Variance of&nbsp;the weekly return using the standard deviation of the weekly return\nYou need to calculate the variance of the weekly return first. The formula for the variance of a set of numbers is the average squared deviation of the individual numbers from the mean.\nvariance = average((x – x̄)2)\nWhere: x indicates each individual's weight, which according to the definition is the same as the height. x̄ indicates the mean, that is, the value we got from step 1.\n\n4. Calculate the variance of VaR\nWhile the VAR for a particular probability level represents the maximum loss with that probability, the calculation of the VAR typically also involves a loss \"factor\" that may be estimated. This loss factor is typically thought to represent the total losses that may be incurred over, say, a two year period. In order to calculate VaR with the step 3 variance, we have to times the factor, which can be thought of as the maximum amount of money that we have and want to be in the bank at the end of the week. This results in the plus or minus figure that you would be assigned to on a Friday if you failed VaR. Instead of hurling you out of the industry, this gives you a chance to adjust your positions for the following week so as to avoid failing VaR again.\n\n5.

            " \n        \nAnswer: The net income of the company is 485 million that indicates that there is a positive cash generation potential. However, this by itself is not an information of much use except as an indicator - it might be combined with other information to gain further insight. Any costs or expenses that are incurred to generate revenue should be subtracted from EBITDA to find out the amount that is left over and available to new investors. The financial report notes that the company spent $270 million depreciating its assets during this reporting period and another $60 million out of its total $523 million purchase of fixed assets to upgrade the facilities of its manufacturing process. In total, 59 million is the increase in accounts receivable and 33 million is the increase in accounts payable which must be paid out to supply the supplies needed over the reporting timeframe. To find the answer to the question, $15 million must be added to these numbers because it increases the money that the company wants to lend to someone else so that the funds are considered notes payable by the company. Additionally, an increase in a taxpayer's assets (e.g., tangible assets, intangible assets, real estate etc. ) that the taxpayer did not compensate for the same period (within the financial statement period) must be added to the expenses since it is an increase in debt and $60 million is an increase in long-term debt since the company is planning to pay money on the debt it has acquired to someone else in the future and these costs should be deducted from the $485 million of the net revenue. The formula for FCFE can be calculated as follows:\n\nFCFE = EBITDA*(T-D)+T+D-1007\n\nwhere EBITDA is $485-270=215 millions, T is 59+33+15=117 millions dollars and D=60+60 = 120 millions dollars.\n\nTherefore, \nFCFE = 215*117+117+120-1007\n\nFCFE = 253+117+120-1007\n\nFCFE = 380-1007"

The stock's total return would be changed by this change in wealth. You can imagine that the returns would be lower. As we borrow more $5,000, the investor may be not so savvy to invest and this also can make the expected returns lower. But on the other hand, the risk-free rate should be more steady...\n\nAnyway, we are not supposed to take a decision here, we just use this change to understand the effects on returns. The portfolio beta of this investor remains same but will have an impact on the average return of the portfolio. Perhaps, since the investor might be more prudent to invest now (because they have more wealth), they may not impact the average return by so much. However, if the investor withdrew $5,000, the average return should decrease significantly. Therefore, if we simulate this, the resulting portfolio beta of the investor borrowing $5,000 should follow alone: '3.55 * 1.03 = 3.6195'\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3.6195.\n"

It also helps management or investors to understand how leverage can impact on the financial outcome of the business. Furthermore, it suggests that leverage not only affects financial cost but also performance and wealth. Without taking financial cost and performance into consideration, the percentage calculation may not give the correct picture how much leverage that firm is creating.\n\"\"\"\n"

            "\n\nStep 1: If we simplify the question, you have a dataset (Exhibit 1) for previous 12 months defaulted loan records and Thompson confirmed the model accurated forecasted for 5,290 cases, I am sure you can find the model's precision by looking at the table Exhibit 1. Look at the column \"Type 2 Error\" and the answer you find there is the model's precision.\n\nStep 2: You can also find the accuracy_score() from sklearn module for \"Type 2 Error\" which is loosely defined as the number of true negatives divided by the total number of actual cased that are nondefault.\n\nStep 2.1: for instance: If a model predicted 80 non-default customers would actually default, and 10 of these predictions were correct (20% of the non-default customers actually defaulted), the accuracy_score for non-defaults would be 90% (80 correct predictions out of 90 non-default customers). so if we find the accuracy_score for non-defaults (i.e. \"Type 2 Error\") in the table Exhibit 1, we find that accuracy_score=894/ 273. Check this for yourself. to see if I am correct.\n\nStep 2.2: Similarly, you can compute accuracy_score for defaults (i.e. \"Type 1 Error\") and see if they match the table Exhibit 1.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer is 894/ 273 =   0.33\nYou can get this answer by checking the table Exhibit 1 and also by using the accuracy_score() from sklearn module."

If the interest rate is increasing from base rate, it means the fiscal liabilities would respond negatively. If the interest rate is decreasing from base rate, it means the fiscal liabilities would respond positively. If the market interest rate changes 100 basis point, then the liability sensitivity changes 100 basis point too.\n\nDuration is measured as the weighted average of full duration changes, not the sum of them. The duration formula expresses each obligation duration as a percentage, then these are added together based on outstanding value of each liability. There are several different duration measures. All these measures will give the same metric, the rate of interest rate change and associated changes in portfolio assets over a fixed amount of time. Saying the portfolio's Value changes as the interest rate changes is only meaningful if the portfolio has interest rate sensitivity.

By examining the z value list and the probability in the chart, you can determine the answer of the question by finding the first value of the z value greater than or equal to 23 from the chart. In this example, that is in the row where z = 24. Therefore, the arbitrary variable is greater than 23 but less than 24. X-sub-1 is associated with probability of 0.5/0.75 = 0.67 Because the two values on the z-curve are 0.75 and 0.67, the z value is located between 0.75 and 0.67. Therefore, the z value is in the range between 24 and 25. If y = 24.5, we have observed that the probability of this value is approximately 0.68. To picture this, observe that Y ≥ 24.5 if X ≤ 0.68. Our stated arbitrary test value was 0.67, which was inside the 24 and 25 z-range. Given that our test value was less than the observed probability of y = z, all we have to do is find the arbitrary test value and multiply it by the probabilities between the two observed values. We can picture this inside the range between X = 0.67 and X = 0.68. Therefore, after you draw a vertical line down from all of the points on the probability line to the value of 0.67, you can compute the accumulated variable at X = 0.67, or 0.67 × 1.15 = 0.76. Because there is not a numerical match in the chart and, as a result, the answer is 0.76, the answer is.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ``%0.2f/n/n/ f\"\"%A\"\"\".

Neither does Stack Overflow. Can you please first post your code?\n\nComment: Python 101.\nValue is not an integer\n\nComment: Hi, and welcome to Stack Overflow. Please take the [tour] and read up on how to [ask]. Your question is also asked, and answered, in all sorts of finance classes. The question is off-topic here, which is most probably why you don't see any answers.\n\nAnswer: Since you know the termination price of the forward contract, which is by definition the price at which you will buy the stock when the contract expires, you can immediately calculate the value of the forward price using the discounted present value formula PV(i, t) = FV / (1+i)^t:\n\n`FV = 107.6`\n`i = 3/100`\n\\begin{code}\n\nt = 0.25\nPV = 107.6 / (1+3/100)^0.25\n\\end{code}\n\nAnd so the value of the stock at quarter termination time will be $92.1218. This is your answer.\n\nIrrespective of the fact that you already know where your forward contract based on a particular stock is headed, if you do not know that, you can still find the theoretical prospective price of the stock at the time of contract termination. This can be done by drawing on below simple pricing equation:\n\nS_M = S_0(\\frac{1 - e^(-rt)}{r}) + F({e^(-rt) - e^(-rT)})\n\nwhere S_0 is the currently forward price, F is your forward contract strike price, r is the risk free interest rate divided by 100, and T is time to maturity in years.\n\nsubscript M and 0 represent the termination and initial stock costs, respectively, r is a risk-free interest rate, and letter e is recommended to be used.\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n"

            "\n\nAnswer: First, we need to get the pretax profit/loss for 2018. This can be calculated by subtracting net cash flow provided by (used in) CFI from net income. We can do this by subtracting $7,200 from $3,560. Then, we times it by -1 to make it into a positive number. Therefore, the pretax profit/loss for 2018 is $6,800. Then, we divide the answer by net income. However, before we can do that, we also need to get the ending net operating assets. For 2018, we have $42,000. Therefore, the pretax profit/loss to net operating assets ratio is 16.67% or 0.1667.\n\nTherefore, the cash-flow-based accruals ratio for PZ in the year 2018 is 0.1667.\n"

Then, we have:\ntrading_gain_delta = 1000.00 - 896.90 = 2.10\n\n2. the trick here is, using the existing benchmark bonds to adjust the world symmetry of interest rates, make two countries having common performance CURVE, therefore, we can substitute the existing benchmark bonds from country A by a mock benchmark bond in country B, and then both countries are under the order of the same interest rate, create a fake market symmetry between two countries.\nFor example, from above, suppose we want to calculate the discounted purchase value of the 3-year corporate bond: price_client_bond = 105.00.\nWe know if this corporate bond could be found from the past market, we can find its discounted value: discount rate is 4.5%\nprice = 105.00;\ntime_to_maturity = 3 years;\ndiscounted_bond = 105.00/(1+0.045)^3 = 86.87\n\nBut for our global bond market, we need to use another bond, the existing market discount praice from UK, and adjust their c"

        "question": "Ultimately, in 2016, Henderson stated that BBBC bought 100% of SongBox (SB), a specific cable music channel in an all-stock transaction. At the point of acquisition, SB had intangible assets for broadcast licenses valued at $2,500. BBBC evaluated the fair market value of these licenses to be $5,500 at that date and estimated the SongBox brand name value to be $2,000, all values are in thousands. The acquisition did not create any goodwill. Prior to the amortization expense calculation, what is the rise in BBBC's intangible assets (in thousands) resulting from the 2016 purchase of SB?",

            "\n\nAnswer:\n\n1. Calculate the intangible assets.\n\nConsider the statement 'BBBC evaluated the fair market value of these licenses to be $5,500 at that date' to calculate the intangible assets from goodwill.\n\nThe formula for the intangible assets is `Intangible assets = License assets + Brand assets + Net goodwill`. Thus `1000 (License assets) + 2000 (Brand assets)`.\n\nThe intangible assets are only valued for the broadcast licenses and the brand name value because:\n\n* there is no net goodwill because `The acquisition did not create any goodwill.`\n* The intangible assets are goodwill free because goodwill is `The excess of the company's value over its book value`.\n\n2. Calculate the amortization expense.\n\nSee Example 2 - Accounting for Acquisition of Intangible Assets in the S-1 filed by Business News Network Limited (BNNL).\n\nSee Example 3 - Microsoft and LinkedIn’s Acquisition: Amortization Expense\n\nThe amortization period is the life of the intangible assets.\n\nGenerally, the amortization period is 20 years. You can check the `Amortization period of intangible assets` in the `General` accounting object class to know how your company calculates the amortization expense for the case of acquisitions.\n\nThe 20 years amortization period begins on the date that the acquisition becomes effective.\n\nThe formula to calculate the amortization expense is `Amortization expense = intangible assets / amortization period of intangible assets`. Thus 1000 / 20 years.\n\nThus the total of amortization expense by the time your company first files a report after the acquisition is 50 dollars.\n\n3. Calculate the intangible assets after the amortization.\n\nAfter the 2016 amortization, the intangible assets have increased by the amortization of intangible assets. Thus 1000 + 50.\n\n4. Calculate the rise in intangible assets.\n\nCalculate the rise in intangible assets by"

Luckily, you have done lots of stress tests in past two years. \nThe portfolio was $150 Million, so it's a big one. \nThe portfolio return is 12% every year, and the volatality is 25%.\nAs we know, an event occured and the portfolio's daily value change was more than 3 standard deviations. That's frighting!!!\nHowever, we cannot just estimate a number without considering it, can we?\nWe need to the job carefully. More over, we need to use the mathmatics to help us!\nFirst, we need consider the volatility, which is given by 25%. That's a percent value. However, what we need is the standard deviation.\nOk, I will do the conversion. \nThe standard deviation = 25% annual volatility / square root ( 365 days ) = 25 / sqrt(365) -> 0.04321\n\nNow, we know the standard deviation, let's tackle the 4-sigma daily event.\nA four sigma event is a relatively rare occurance that occurs with a probability = 1 / (4^2) = 0.03%\nTenky! Hmm, this is still too less meaningful to estimate the value chaneg.\nBut recall that we know the annual return of this portfolio. So we can estimate its daily return.\nMaybe we may need to convert from annual return to daily return, given the number of working days in one year.\nUsing the idea from the previous lesson, the daily rate of return = ((1 + AnnualRate)^(1/365)) - 1. Let's plug in the value:\n((1 + 12%) ^ (1/365)) - 1 = 0.0137440216931\nNow we want to calculate the change in daily value for our 4-sigma event. \nThe change in daily value is 4 sigma times the daily volatility, which we have calculated as (0.04321).\nSo the change in daily value is (12%/365 days) of a 4 sigma event = 0"

            "\nThe concept, or mindsight we needed to answer this question is :\n1. The money flow in the binomial is not available from the table, but in Display 1. In a way that D1, D2, D3 is all available come from D0, and the money comes from down. Therefore we compute from bottom to up\n2. Along the path in a binomial tree, a bond's value should conserved: \nAccumulated value = Present value\n3. Given you have value from step 1 to step 2. Step 2's value minus the step 1's value also presents you what accrued. Then sum up all the accrues along a path during the time from Time 0 to Time n-1 (for 6 months to n years)\n4. The maturity is a critical point for a bond, and after the maturity, a bond is not changed and never accrued and never hold\n5. You cannot directly use `discount` but instead multiplying it is OK!\n\nAnd the detail step is like...\n---\n1. Transform the current value from Time 0 to Time 1\n2. Added `up` and `down` values that mimics the regular geometric behaviour from Time 0 to Time 1\n3. For each `step up` x, multiplies D1 by ((1 + D1) + 1), because this is essentially a discount for each step. As a result we can say as `up` part that D1 increases as time moves forward, while the D2 and D3 are not interested, we do reacting to the Time 0 to Time 1 part\n4. The net value we want to ask for is the upper node, and that's D2 multiplying by (1+ D2)\n5. Hence the answer is 1.500% * ((1+1.0000%) * (1+1.1648%)) = 1.6521%\n(I used D1-D8 to mark the steps, but you don't need to know this while solve the question.

So this is correct. Let's see the word and its meaning in the question.\n\nQuestion: What is the delta of a long forward contract on a property with a 10% annum dividend yield and six months to maturity?\nthe words with forward contract, 10% annum dividend yield, and six months to maturity is used in the question. The words can be found in material books. \n\nSo we look up information on these words. We first read the definition of forward contract to make sure it would be applicable to the question. We then read the information regarding dividend yield and maturity. After looking up the information, we would understand that we are dealing with option as stated in the word forward contract, the dividend yield of 10% annum, and the maturity duration is six month. We are supposed to the calculate the delta and there is no calculation necessities in the question. So the delta is not a question from the appearance of the word forward contract.\n\nSo far, we conclude that we can't answer the question. However to get a higher grade you might write additional sentences to elaborate your arguments to show that \"the answer is 0\". This can give you more credits.\nTherefore, the answer is 0\n\nActually we think we got enough time to do the math for calculating the delta after the previous time.

You have a traditional balance sheet with liabilities, assets, and equity, as well as a profit and loss statement with items such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, revenue, and cost of goods sold.\n- Most of the questions with this format have a small table of values to give you a starting point.

The financing includes $6 million in debt, $3.6 million in preference shares with a 15% annual return paid out at exit, and $0.4 million in common equity. The projected exit value in six years is $15 million, with an expected decline in debt of $2.8 million in the six years before exit.

In finance, we often call the years, 'periods' or 'time periods' and the fractions the Time Value of Money (TVY). This is because the value of the 1-year zero-coupon bond is the present value of 98 + the 5/10 of 1% of 198 on November 1, 2022.\n\nLike many finance questions, let's look at the definition of the Time Value of Money (TVY) using the equation, F = dC/(1+r/n)^n.

The gross profit is $4,000,000 - $3,000,000, which is $1,000,000.\n\nSecond, after get gross profit, we need to add the operating and administrative expenses, which are the other operating expenses and interest expense. The other operating expenses is $500,000, interest expense is $100,000. So, we need to add $600,000 to the gross profit. Now, the gross profit is $1,600,000.\n\nFinally, we need to add the tax expense to the gross profit. So, we need to add $120,000 to $1,600,000. Now, the Net profit i $1,720,000. \nStep by step, we can get the answer. The answer is $1,720,000. whether is the correct answer."

The first one is relatively arbitrage profit -- it is an profit compared to a related bond if two assets are equally risky. Absolutely, refer to arbitrage profit including the interest -- it is an profit from arbitrage, considering the bond accrues interest along its path.\nWe need to calculate the relationshiop between the bond and the futures contract first, and then compare the profit of the bond separately, and the same time recover the profit from arbitrage.\n\nThere are three key things to think about for this question:\n1. Time to expiry.\n2. Accrued interest. \n3. Price ratio between bond futures and bond.\n\nFirst of all, consider the time to expiry -- the futures contract is about to be expired in three months, which reveals it is a short-term futures contract.\nSecondly, account for stipulations related to accrued interest. The bond would see the accrued interest in time, and this is inconsequential. In contrast, the futures contract does not have inherent annoucement of accrued interest, but it recieves the accrued interest on the principal.\nFinally, price ratio between bond futures and real bond. The future's contract price and the underlyng price is related, and their close relative ratio emerges. \nFollowing these steps to treat questions like this one will avoid mistakes and enable you to design the algorithm.\n\n```\nThree months to maturity and the coupon for the bond is .5875%, which is the rate necessary to par (and settle) the bond futures contract.\nIn addition, one-month corporate Treasuries with terms to settlement are priced at 68.97%, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange basis swap (coupon rate minus one-month Treasury rate) tends to average 68.39% annually as of October 2018.

The usual is 30-60 days for the full payment.

Because the longest it takes for 30-60 days we will have to pay.\n\nAt this time next year is 10th of November,  if next year is 11th of November, this means that the purchases are fully paid until November.

That's an important step!\nNow, we can use Bayes' theorem P(good rating | insolvency) to rewrite the question as follows:\nin solvin\nP(insolvency|good rating) = P(insolvency)P(good rating|insolvency)\nWe know that 50% of higher bonds become insolvent (since 20% of high bonds become insolvent, and 30% of lower bonds), so the first factor is equal to 0.5.\nTo figure out the second factor, we need to calculate the chance of an investment with a high rating becoming insolvent.\nGiven that the model"

After one year, the investment in Gamma is valued at GBP80million and the investment in XYZ is valued at GBP140 million.

In our calculation, the one year return of Gamma investment should be 0.2, which means there's a deviation. I think the investment value of Gamma should be 120 million, not 80 million.\n\nSo, let's update if we have a 120 million investment in Gamma by the end of the first year:\nGamma investment return = (120-100)/100 = 0.2 or (20%)\nXYZ investment return = (140-100)/100 = 0.4 or (40%)\n\nThe next step is to figure out the fee. After Sagittarius POP has collected 1% of the total assets as a management fee, they would receive a 10% incentive fee if the portfolio returns at least X% for a year, where X is the level of performance you've set. For example, if the portfolio returns X%, and X equals 15%, they'd pay 15% of the fee to the fund managers as incentives.\n\nThe level of performance is not given in the question, so let's assume it is 15% for example.

As the formular shown below,\nWe can easily know that the return excess is (15.5% - 2.5% - 15.5% * beta) = 15.5% - 2.5% - 15.5% * 1.2 = 10%.\nHowever, beta * marketReturn (1.2 * 11.8%) = 14.16% exceeds 2.5%. How can it be? because some securities may have negative beta values and this can offset some of the impact of bad stock performance by tending to shift the portfolios performance to a trajectory above that of the market.\n2. As stated in here, Jensen's alpha is the return expected by a portfolio above the market portfolio. For instance, if the market return is 12.5% and your investment return is 12.8%, your investment has really buy and low risk compared to private security. I mean you created excess value over the conventional securities.\n```\n\n### Answer\nTherefore, the answer is 13.7% (15.5% - 12.5%, Jensen's alpha)."

A portfolio strategist would need to define whether or not they speculate in a portfolio, that is as return unexpected in terms of a direction of how they perceive the broader economy in making gain in strategy.\nIf expected value is deemed to be near the mean value with certainty, an investment is not viewed as risky. However, any piece of data that assures that the next return is within the mean is therefore also pre-assumed that the next observation will be within the boundaries of something that was previously thought to be a normal distribution which defines all given returns of values under specific logic in real current market conditions. Thus implying whether or not that is an actual good investing strategy depends entirely on short-selling, where value can be gained from shares in the market rather than buying stock in a company. If short selling is permitted under the speculated portfolio strategy model, then other variables come into play in modeling the potential return.\nAre there relevant events and schedules? Is the risk due to a macro or micro level issue? What if an event is significant enough to warrant a loss?\nUltimately, a loss on a given strategy may be the result of channel focus from a political point of view (governments overspending and spending today on a some futile or frivolous system of value now that they did not work on a sustainable"

            " This is called reverse engineering. To answer this question, we need to build a formula first.\n\nFor example, let's say we have two of these financial firms - Alpha and Beta. The fees are $99 and $101 for each 1% increase in the stock price.\n$99 and $101 are the required return rate of Alpha and Beta, respectively.\n\nFor example, Alpha:\nthe stock price is $100, but the accountant is asking for $99 to buy it from Tom.\nBut if Alpha increase the stock price to $101, the accountant can sell it at $101 to Tom. \nTherefore, Alpha can get the difference between 101 and 99 = $2 by selling and buying at 1%.\nThe same as Beta,\nthe stock price is $100, but the accountant is asking for $101 to buy it from Tom.\nBut if Beta increase the stock price to $102, the accountant can sell it at $102 to Tom. \nTherefore, the accountant can get the difference between 102 and 101 = $1 by selling and buying at 1%.\n\nTherefore, the formula is Preferred stock price per share (P) / Fee rate per increase in stock price per percent (r).\nBut to get the required return rate of Alpha is $99, so P / r = 1 %/(99-100) as the money can be given back.\nSo the answer is 1 percentage / (99-100)=1.111111.\nTo simplify the answer, just get the first three decimal places and the answer is 1.111. \n\nAnswer: Therefore, the answer is 1.111.\n\n*/\nclass Probs14 {};"

            "\n\nFirstly, you should know what \"Portfolio return\" and \"Portfolio Variance\" mean.\nA portfolio is an investment made up of two or more assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds. The return or price return or growth rate of a portfolio is the gain or loss incurred by an investor on investments within the portfolio, expressed as a ratio, and is typically measured over a specific period of time, such as a day, a week, a month, a quarter or a year. Portfolio variance is a measure of risk associated with a portfolio. It's measured by the standard deviation of returns associated with the portfolio, or how much the returns on the portfolio vary from their mean.\nNext, you need to understand what \"Covariance\" means.\nCovariance is a measure of how two or more random variables vary in relation to each other. Variaition between two random variable is another way to explain it.\n\ncov(X,Y)=E(Y-E(Y)(X-E(X))^2/{n-1}\n\nThere is one original covariance, which is the covariance between the portfolio return and each stock's return.\nLet the stock's return be denoted as X, and the portfolio return be denoted as Y.\nThere is also another kind of covariance, which is the covariance the two stocks combined.\nLet the combine stocks return be denoted as X', and the portfolio return be denoted as Y'\nSimilar as the original result, let the percentage of the stock 1 and stock 2 in the portfolio be denoted as a and b.\nX'=aX+bX\nY'=aY+bY\n\nSo the number should be sum(combination(n+1,2))+1  "

His tax basis amount for the shares on 12/31/2016 is $900,000, and his EOY 2016 market price per share is $1,500. So Cook has a gain of $300,000 ($750,000 market value of shares less Cook's tax basis of shares). The tax that Cook pays now comes from the immediately recognized 10% of inherent gains. The 10% realized gain tax to be paid is approximately $30,000. This fully utilizes Cook's annual tax rate or $30,000 (see tax brackets below).

To know this, let's compute the effective return [I = (1 + rate)^n - 1]. The n here is the number of periods compounded per year. In this case, the rate is the monthly rate that we want to determine, so let's denote it by m. There is 12 periods in a year for a monthly basis, so n = 12. The semiannual yield-to-maturity can be expressed such way: [I = (1 + 2*m)^(1/2) - 1].This is the function: I = (1 + 2*m)^(1/2) - 1.To determine the monthly rate that yields the same discount as the semiannual bond, we need to solve for m. In other words, which m solves I = (1 + 2*m)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.1622(0.1622 is the semiannual yield-to-maturity) ?The answer is approximately 2.89% per annum.Thus, 4 percent would be the answer.Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nWow!

We don't have to pay attention to the currencies which are different from the above two currencies because they are not related to our question. The first thing we need to do is to calculate things as reverse payment since we want to know how many USD could be gained for how many AUD.\nThe one-year forward exchange rate in the spot market is calculated using the infamous formula known as both Black and Garman's formula. The interest rate can be calculated for one year by using the capital multipler. The interest rate for USD is 3% since it is given. We need to calculate the interest rate for AUD. Let's say that AUD's spot market rate is AUD's forward market rate in the current spot market, the interest rate is calculated by AUD/USD*value of USD-AUD since USD is equal to the per unit of AUD.\nConsider a simple model for valuing a pair of assets; two instruments, assets A and B, where A with a continuously compounding interest rate r, and a spot rate S (A-B), a continuous forward from the current time to theirs expiration, A-Bt, both have an a clean price S' and S'' respectively. So, profit/loss of a trader buying and holding is:\nPt={S*e^(rt)}-S\nwhere S't is the corresponding continuous forward rate. Moreover, for a trader buying asset B at forward rate S't and holding until it reaches its expiry, there is any return on a forward S' ---A/Bt. By definition of a post-expriration value, this leads to:\nPt=D(S)t-S't\nwhere the value of a derivative measures its fair value S' is known, therefore. But this is again simply (using that the forward rate at expiration is equal just the spot, and that e^t as equal to 1):\nPt=D(S)t-D(S)t, which obliges Pt=0.\nSo DA(t)=0, which expands into r=0.\nWe can calculate the interest rate for AUD."

It can be calculate as follow:\nBeta = (Cov(Return(Portfolio), Return(Index))/Volatility(Index))/(Volatility(Portfolio)/Volatility(Index)))\nwhere Cov is the Covariance of two variables.\nWe need to keep the same portfolio value, thus the weight of portfolio do not change. Suppose you sold some S&P futures contracts. Let the negative number of S&P futures contracts accounted for an abs size amount. Through this auction process, you neither gain any money nor loss any money in terms of the prices of S&P futures. This should mean the return of the portfolio equals to zero. But the beta of portfolio will be changed after you sold S&P futures contracts. The smaller beta you want, the more number of S&P futures contracts you should sell. How to calculate the number of S&P futures contracts? The Covariance is not a linear function of the displacement of the two variable. You should further detial how they are changed with the displacement. But we can utilize the theory of repsect to manipulate the portfolio against a normalized index with unit value [1]. After differentiating the Covariance, it is show that the change of ratio shoule be equal to the differnce of number of S&P futures contracts to the increase in point of beta[2].\nAs the S&P value does not change, the change of ratio is actually the number of S&P futures contracts divided by the initial market value of the S&P futures contract. The beta in question is 1.1, thus the new beta should be 0.75. Therefore, 1.1-0.75=0.35. The S&P futures contract market value was 1,457*250=364,500,000 after selling some futures contract, the index is no longer broad stock market, we need to change the market value to the number of S&P futures contracts.

This implies that such credits will either increase their credit rating (such credits tends to advance to AA) or degrade their credit score (such credits tend to drop to BBB).\n\n====\nStep 2:\n\nLocation 'an inventory of credits for this risk category' better indicates the credits that tend to advance from A to AAA. We can infer that A-ranked entities that upgraded to AAA have a probability of 1. This is because if any entity has a mark of A, there isn't a chance their mark will rise above AAA. Finding the probability A credits will advance to AAA.\n\nFor A given entity to experience such a change, it needs to finish, debt collect the entity they are entrusted to and open a new account that reflects the new score. For this event to happen, several additional constraints should be met.\n\nThus, the probability of such an occurrence is (The probability of A credits advancing to AAA) = 1/ (The sum of probabilities of A credits advancing to BBB, AA, AAA, or remaining A).\n\nIn line with the same analogy, the probability that A credits advance to BBB, AA, or get demoted to BBB can be calculated. Moreover, the probability that A credits remain A can also be found.\n\nWhen you sum up all possible outcomes, you'll get the sum of the probabilities mentioned above. Moreover, you divide this sum total by the probability to establish a ratio. The probability of A-ranked entities advancing to AAA from A is this ratio.\n\n====\n\nStep 3:\nGiven that the probability that the creditor experiences a demotion is approximately 2.15%.\n\nYou can interpret this as though each year about 2.15% of the credits in this grade segment might have their credit ratings downgraded to BBB.\nFrom this, you can infer that the native credit rating of entities continues to be A with 97.99%. Approximately 2.15% of just half of those who spent a year not receiving any demotions ended up on default.\n"

The data comes from bins of two time periods, and the price of these bonds is in the form of a triangle. The known value of the bond in both of the two periods are determined, in the table S0 is the start of the bond in the Time = 0, where the price of the bond begins is $100, and the price of the bond in Time = 1, where we know that the price of the bond at the start of the second period before buying or selling is $110, we look at the end price. The end of the Bond or the exchange is the die value after the completion of the creation at a given time.\nAnd what we needed is the Time = 2, the end price of the Bond after the buyer or seller makes a decision based on their probability to raise or fall the price after the bond is in the selling market for the second time in a row.\n\nHence, someone ask us to find the probability of finding a bond with the price of $101.20 after the second time of buying and selling. We need to count the same probability of finding this price in the material table provided above, where all other values are known conclude from this table.\n\nSo, what we have from this table if we analyze it closely,\n\nFor the first level we can see the Time = 0, given that the bond has a starting price of $100, there is again a 40% likelihood of rise and 60% likelihood of fall respectively as required by the term.\nFrom there we can see that there is a table that shows the increase or decrease value of the Bond at a given point that begins from the starting price of the level that connects to Level 1, Table's [Sd,Su], where Sd & Su are parallelogram whose adjacent value begins from the price changes of the bond described in the question as:\n1.

Let's primarily focus on estimating DBF. Note that we use the double-declining-balance method, which means the residual value is zero.

In math terms, 'YTM\\*((1+YTM)^YTM) = -4000', which results in a mathemetical result of 'YTM=0.00378404'. Since interest is not payed, the rate of the cost should be the YTM minus the inflation rate of 3%, you can set a flat YTM for the budget, which is equal to 'YTM (-3%=0.0034, hence the effective cost is 0.00034).\n\n4.

Using historical EPS made the PE different from the other method by 1.6% and made the future EPS 6.5% higher.\n\nLet's look at the two formulae to understand the difference in calculation.\n \nAverage ROE method:\n\nPE = (P/E) = (MarketPricePerShare / Normalized EPS)\nNormalized EPS = (EBIT / Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding) \n                 except for EPS calculation\n\nAverage Earnings: \nNormalized EPS = (EBIT / WA Shares) * ((1 - tax rate) / ROE)\n\nA Discounted Cash Flow approach would be more appropriate when considering Davis's seasonal activity. However, the analysis done for this problem uses the income statement, rather than the cash flow statement.\n\nWe know that normalized EPS is calculated as EPS / (1 - tax rate). This is equal to the dividend that is paid divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Their value is already contained within the company, so no brief technical analysis is required to find information about profitability.

As you know, the retiree will receive a certain amount of money when he reaches Corporation age.\n\nThe question asks us to calculate regular pension expense. Regular pension expense simply looks like an expense at present. There is another type of the pension expense called accelerated pension expense. In short, accelerated pension expense regards imprudence of current discount rate. \n\nAccording to the table in the description, we know the present value of corp pension obligation, which is PV_obligation=48,395,000*(-0.075)=6,429,000 make it 6,516,925.65 with two decimals.\nPlus, Benefit obligation at end of year is the requirement of retiree regular pensions from the employer, which is calculated according to the following formula: End balance=Current balance*interest rate/discount rate. Here, Current balance and interest rate are both presented in the table.\n\nTherefore, accelerated pension expense=PV_obligation+End balance, which is 6,429,000+(48,395,000*8,2%/7.5%)=86,231,492.40\nSo, the regular pension expense in this case is accelerated pension expense=86,231,492.40\n\nTherefore, the answer is 86,231,492.40 millions\n"

Each odd value of Y is essentially independent of every other value; that is, you do not need to preserve the ordering of the yes/no answers to apply the normal distribution.

Suppose, we need to check if the given zip code is available for zipping the orders in a tools website. If the zip code is available for zipping, then we print the message “Pick a location. Otherwise, we print the message “Zip is not available.”\n\nIn the above code, we define the available zip codes “Takeout” and “Doortodoor” and store them in a list “zip”. Then we check if the ith element of the list zip is equal to “Takeout”. If it is equal to “Takeout”, then we print the required message “Pick a location”. Else, we print the other message “Zip is not available”.\n\nSince the zip codes we provide in the list are nothing but strings, we have used “==” operator. The “==” operator returns True if both the items being compared are the same. For example, in this case, it returns True because the string stored in the zip[0] is “Takeout”.\n\nIf you don’t have a list, but a tuple instead, you can still check the contents of the tuple using either of the three methods described in the article, with very minimal modifications.

Let's calculate it as follows.\nThe GDP growth rate in Nation Y for the year 2017 is calculated with the following formula: GDP(2017)-GDP(2016)/GDP(2016)=($220 billion-$200 billion)/$200 billion=0.1\nThe value is 10% if GDP(2017) were frozen at $200 billion. Then theoretically, the GDP of $220 billion in GDP(2017) would represent an additonal $20 billion in the flow of the nation's total output.\nTo prepare the deflator for GDP(2017)using the base year's GDP, we would divide the annual growth rate (0.1 in this instance) by one minus the growth rate; therefore, 0.1/?0.9=1.111. This is the multiplicative factor that, when applied to the flow of GDP (the multiplicand) would turn the value of the flow of this nation output into 2016 dollars.\nThis is composed of recent output that was valued at current prices in the base year ($200 billion) as well as an increase of 10% annually since the base year. For the base year 200 billion we use this formula to calculate deflator. The GDP(2017) deflator value would be composed of GDP(200 billion)*0.1 or $200*0.1=$20 since 10% from the 200 billion base period output would equal $20 billion. Another factor is $200 billion*(1+0.1)=220 billion Commence 200 billion's output is purchased at current prices in the base year, and GDP(2017) is composed of an additional $20 billion in output valued at the annual prices of 2017, noted as $220 billion-20 billion.\nThe GDP deflator"

If they swap with floating rate, they will save (1.5% (LIBOR) + 150bps) - 8%. The interest expense for a floating rate borrower is dependent on the LIBOR rate, and that changes by the day.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the break-even LIBOR rate needed for swap. (We will use 1.5% as the short term LIBOR rate to simplify this explanation.)\n\nNow, into the calculation that is used to calculate the swap rate. Replacing 8%, you get:\n\nNow, simplifying the problem to just use a 1.5% LIBOR for corporation A, the break-even LIBOR for B becomes:\nNow the break-even LIBOR for corporation A becomes:\nSince B is paying a greater interest to borrow money from corporation A and A is paying a smaller amount to borrow from B, corporation A needs to ensure they are making at least 210bps difference by swapping with corporation B. The break even rates will only be triggered when the short LIBOR rate hits 2.6%. 1.5% + 210 bps = 2.6%\n\nStep 3: Further analysis to determine the savings or benefit aggregate amount.\nBased on the break even LIBOR rates you have now calculated for each correlation A and B, think in terms of different scenarios:\n- What would happen if the LIBOR rate remains the same but stays at 1.5%? Who is actually making more from borrowing versus how much that the other corporation is saving?\n- What happens if the LIBOR rate decreases, but not by quite enough to meet the break even level?

Because the yield to maturity is directly linked to the price of the note.\n\nLet's assume a general formula P(ytm) for the price of the note and ytm for the yield to maturity. The yield to maturity affects the price of the note, so there are (in most of the cases) ties between the price of the note and ytm.\n\nWhen we know some of the ytm-price ties, we can build a price function.

            " First, the definition of forward rate is obvious, so there is no confusion with this part of the question. Second, to generate the forward rate we first need to break up the spot rates into their respective current and future components. For example, the 1-year spot rate of 8.528% can be broken up into its current component of rc = (1/n) = 0.01 and its future component of rf = (1-1/n)\\*rf = 0.0901. These definitions become more complicated when there is an exponential component to the interest rate but 8.528% does not have one.\nAre there any other considerations or formulations? No, as a financial expert you only need to consider the algorithm posted above. But this algorithm hasn't had the forward rate explicitly defined in its formulation. However, from reading the introductory text you can reason that all the formulations give the same numerical results. The one that is typically taught in schools however is not what you have given above so those calculations can be correctly stated by the student.\nAre there any other considerations or formulations? Let's look at the Wikipedia page for forward rates and the section on 'Compound Periodic Rates'. First, we have to find the periodic equivalent yield of the forward and spot rates. In general finding that rate requires information that is not provided by the problem. However, given that the rate will be somewhere between the exact value of the forward valuation and the exact value of the spot valuation we exercise a shortcut by choosing the period length for finding the periodic rate equal to a year rather than a quarter and setting the periodic yield equal to the spot rate. What is the periodic equivalent yield for the spot half year and the forward one year? The spot rate is 0.01 and the operator (1+\\frac{rf}{n})^n-1 = 8.528% or we can write the latter in terms of the goals stated at the beginning of the section. The forward rate that we stated as a 1-year forward rate starting now is 0.090128 but half of that is 0.045064 which gives us our periodic equivalent of the half year spot rate. We have to do the same equation as before and solve for the future rate length in the period being used to find the periodic equivalent of the forward rate"

Here's why: Since the interest rate is 8%, $100 a year from now would be worth $92 in today's dollars. This means that your money would grow to $92 after one year of investment, so it makes sense that you cannot spend all of that money today and have it worth $100 – you'd more or less have to take what's left over. Consider it again another way: if you earn 8% per year, you'll get increased principal as well as interest. You'll get higher and higher principal amounts, too. If you paid $100 a year from now and just kept adding seven percent to the amount inflated (amount inflated = $100 x (1 + $rate)*$number of years), that's how you calculate when you'd have $100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3%\n\n\nRunning BC-11.02.22 from the command line will allow you to input the choice \"a\" to se this answer.\n"

When present value of cash flows resulting from the fifteen coupon payments is $\\$13.24 for a discount of $\\$122.99 between the $96 and the present value of the coupon chugs and the face value, thus yield a FRN discount margin of 96.24% - 96 or $.18 per $\\$100 of par value. The discount margin is 1800/96 or 18.66%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 18.66%.\n"

The zero-coupon bond with a maturity term of one year has a yield of 4.0%.\n\nLet's figure out the answer step by step:\n\nStep 1: Find the discount rate for each period.\nThe zero-coupon bond with a maturity term of one year has a yield of 4.0%. So the discount rate is 4.0%/1 = 0.04.\nThe zero-coupon bond with a maturity term of two years has a yield of 5.0%. So the discount rate is 5.0%/2 = 0.05.\nThe zero-coupon bond with a maturity term of three years has a yield of 6.0%. So the discount rate is 6.0%/3 = 0.06.\n\nStep 2: Find the discount price of the zero-coupon bond with a four-year term.\nThe bond with a four-year term will be broken down into two zero-coupon bonds, one with a two-year term and another with a two-year term. The price of the two zero-coupon bonds will be the forward price denoted as 0.8479 and another 0.8479 * 0.06 = 0.5281. The price of the bond with a four-year term would be $0.8479 + 0.5281 = 1.376.

Can you explain the formulae used in FCFF, and what is the difference between Wacc and FCF ?\n\nAnswer: It is not clear what your table is presenting.  You have two income statements as well as a continuity equation, but no balance sheets.\n\nThe first step is to solve for $2018$ to obtain the current value of accounts receivable, $800$, and long-term debt, $1.5\\times\\text{CFF}_{2017}$.  The second step is to compute the fixed charge provision in $2018$, which does not depend on the current balances of the accounts since $CFF$ depends only on those balances.\n\nConsequently, the answer to the exercise should be $800+1.5\\times\\text{CFF}_{2017}+\\text{I}\\,2018-\\left[\\left(0.68\\times\\text{CFF}_{2017}+\\text{P}_7\\times\\text{P}_6\\right)+\\text{IA}\\,2018\\right]=1500$.\n\nYour remaining mystery to yourself, I guess, is then how to recover the net present value of the last term at $0.08$; this yields $\\boxed{800}$.\n\nComment: Sir,"

There are four factors listed in the table, so there should be four rows of figures of the market factor return and covariances. However, we are only given one row of numbers, which shows that all the four factors' market factor return and covariances are the same, 0.0038369. Health is the market factor, therefore it is listed in the market factor return and covariances column of the table. We can use this information to answer the question.\n\nWe have to find the variance of the market factor (Absolute account). Of course, the first place we can find the answer is in the question. The total value of the fund is 427124, the portfolio's monthly standard deviation of returns is 0.034. We can calculate the variance estimation by, Portfolio Variance = Portfolio standard deviation ^2, so we get Squared Portfolio Standard Deviation = 3.74 * 3.74 = 14.1564 (4 dp).\n\nThen obtain the contribution of the market factor (Absolute account) to the total portfolio variance, using Cramer's Formula. It goes like this: Contribution of the market factor (Absolute account) to the total portfolio variance = Contribution of the market factor (Absolute account) to the total portfolio value * (Variance of the market factor return and covariances with the market factor return (Health absolute account) ^2). We then take the square for market factor return and covariances of 0.0038369, so it returns 0.0001553326.\n\nFinally, divide the contribution to the portfolio value by the portfolio variance, which goes like Contribution of the market factor (Absolute account) to the portfolio variance / Portfolio variance \\* 100, and then we multiply the result by 100\\. The result is (0.141564\\*0.141564)/1 = 0.0200110 or 2.00%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2%.\n\n#Q:\nSource: https"

            " We need to calculate the new average days outstanding, to obtain the new total receivable amount. Then, we calculate the change amounts, the accounts receivable balance. Finally, we subtract the final answer from the new average accounts receivable balance.\n\nIn the first step, we calculate the new average days outstanding. This means we have to subtract the number of average days outstanding from the market average. We can obtain this result by subtracting the days the companies receive payment their invoice from the days the companies send the invoice to the customers.\n\n```\nnew average days outstanding = 15 - 19 = -4\n```\n\nHowever, we cannot accept negative numbers. We get a negative value because we are reducing the days for collection. This means Farrow is reducing the time the customers give payment for the invoices.\n\nLet's resolve this issue. We assume the difference between market average days and the average days outstanding as weeks. This means we need to add delta first as aligned with the market average days. then, transform the weeks into days.\n\n```\nnew average days outstanding = (-4)*7 = -34 + 19 = 6\n```\n\nTherefore, the new average days outstanding are 6 days.\n\nLet's focus on our next step, obtaining the new total receivable amount. It's required to multiple the new average days outstanding with the new credit sales. No need to worry about the > sign. We know the new average days outstanding are positive.\n\n```\nnew total receivable amount = 6 * 390,000,000 = 234,000,000\n```\n\nIn the third step, we calculate the change amounts, the accounts receivable balance. We can obtain this result by dividing the difference between the total receivable amount and the new total receivable amount by 2. However, we still have a negative number. It means the logo is reducing the total receivable amount.\n\nLet's resolve this issue by taking the absolute value.\n\n```\nchange amount = |\\'234000000 - 650000000| = 416000000\n```\n\nFinally, we subtract the change amount"

The face amounts of the preferred stock need not be paid to the holders of such stock until the company has a cash surplus.

It is crucial to know the concept of straight-line method, accumulated depreciation, and Book value.\nThe definition of straight-line method is:\nThe straight-line method assigns the same value to each unit of a depreciable asset over its useful life, which means each unit is equally depreciable. \nThe following equation can be used to calculate the annual depreciation expense: DR = D x r\nwhere DR is the annual depreciation expense (depreciation rate times cost of equipment).\nNext, it is related to accumulated depreciation which is the total of all of the previous years’ airline depreciation expense.\nWe can calculate accumulated depreciation formula based on the last year depreciation which is DR (DR is the annual depreciation expense which can be found by using DR = D x r) and the previous accumulated depreciation Ai-1 is the total of previous year accumulated depreciation. \n$Ai = Ai-1 +DR$. The sum of depreciation is the cost of depreciation which we can calculate by cost of equipment - accumulated depreciation and hence, we can replace accumulated depreciation with sum of depreciation $B = A - (Ai-1 + DR) = A - Ai$ but it is not given complete. \n$D = (A+B)/2$ and you can find Utilities Life from the table and hence we can see that $Ai = 500000 + 500000/5 = 550000 + 50000 = 600000$\n\nFinally, the answer is 600000.\nTherefore, the answer is 600000."

            " What is the fundamental idea of this question about how the hedge funds are organized, such as two-tier structure of the funds?\nAmong them, the basis fee is based on the net asset value, and the incentive fee is a percentage of the performance fee, and the dynamics of the two fee models can affect each other right?\nTherefore the value of the overall fund will be the basis of the performance fee, and the total fee of both managed funds will be the basis of the incentive fee.\nSo let's calculate that figure first.\nThe performance fee is 1%, and let's start our calculation by finding the management fee and its basis. First we'll make sure we start from the same value. So the fund is up by $33 million, or 33%. Then we can calculate the management fee, which is calculated based on the end-of-year NAV. In this case, it's $100 million for the previous year and $133 million for this year. So the difference is $33 million. The management fee by a basis, that is $1/year, than is only $3 million.\nNext we'll find the basis total for the performance fee, both before and after the management fee basis. So the basis before management fee is $100/year=100 basis point. Then the basis after the management fee lets calculate it as $133 million - $3 million = $130 million. Then the basis after the fee $130 million/year = 130 basis point. The difference is $30 basis point, which is 2.94% to two decimal places if I calculate.\nNext we'll find the amount value of the incentive fee. So they are net of the management fee. Then the management fee is the incentive fee basis. So it is $3 million. The management fee basis is 1%, which is $3 million/year = $27 thousand/month. Similarily, the basis total is $129 million/year = $102 thousand/month.\nNext we'll determine the amount of the incentive fee. So the sentense is that the incentive fee is for all funds, and also for a specific performance. Which means all the all the funds all have this specific performance. Then the calculation is $"

The face value of a bond is its par value at maturity, the amount it is worth then. It’s the smallest amount that will acceptable buy the bond while it matures. Usually it’s the amount of the bond. The annual interest rate is the amount that is being paid to hold the bond. That’s the term we use to buy the face value of the bond at the end of the period.  Therefore, I will face value of that bond to put it in my final sentence.\n\nThen let’s think about YTM, I am going to do the same thing that I did before. that is to ‘I want to find out how to find the yield to maturity of a bond using the semi-annual formula’ like left. Then I am going to output it in my final sentence like this. \n\nLet the cost be x. \n\nIf the bond's face value is blue, the annual payment are yellow, and the yield to maturity is green, then the semi-annual payments for one-half year are blue/yellow*red(1/(1+0.5*red))^1.  The cost of the bond is the sum of the semi-annual payments.  In this case the cost is 100 / 10(1+0.5\\*12) = 100 / 11.77 = 8.59.  Therefore, the answer is 8.59\n Let’s look at annual interest rate.  This is 12% per annum.\n\nthe semi-annual interest rate is the annual percentage divided by 2 so it will be 6.  The interest payment in the first year of the bond are face value \\* semi-annual interests.  Face value are 100 and the semi-annual will be (100 \\* 6%) and the interest rate of the first year are 6.

            "\n1.The question ask us to find the 'return' of a specific 'year', which appears 10 times in the table. However, only 4 quintile is mentioned. Therefore, write a sentence to state this and let's index those 10 years. The index is as follow: if we start at 0 and add one to the index each year, we get index = 0,1,2,3 and so on. Consider quintile as the 5th dimension of a 5D matrix where the 4 elements in the vector correspond to the return of the fourth quintile of a specific year.\n2.Thus, the exhibit provides a certain number of return values (40, specifically). Each return value corresponds to a 5-dimensional int vector. For instance, the first number of our vector is 15.25, corresponding to 1st quintile in 1st year and so on.\n3.The problem ask us to find the highest quintile (in total and out of those 40) corresponding to the return of he fourth quintile of a specific year. Which is 30.79 in Year6 of our question. \n4.With the index '30', we can find the number '30.79' in the database of return values and confirm it as the return to the fourth quintile of a specific year. \n\nWith those steps, the answer to the question in the given table is: 30.79%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30.79."

And others you used as well?\n\nComment: by MC and TC I mean marginal cost curve and Total cost curve. I thought TR is contained in the table you provided, please look for TR..\n\nComment: Even, normally you should use normal notation for variables, so marginal cost curve becomes MC, total cost curve becomes TC and so on. like MR for marginal revenue curve and TR for total revenue curve.\n\nComment: Your answers look very definite but it is not practical to graph curves on a 2D paper, practically they are not plotted where the x-axis is Q unless Q is a linear function. MC and AC curve are usually not that way, but either arched or slanted or both. Therefore asking Q is not appropriate when there is uncertainty or randomness, whereas talking about MR/MC and TR/TC are appropriate.\n\nComment: I think that he considers the following sample problem first:\n\nLet $f(x) = 2x-\\frac{1}{x}$ with $x\\neq 0$.

            "\n\nThe first step is to understand what the question is asking. Use the question title, summary, and/or content to expound.\n\nThe question summary gives a context, which states that Anna carried out a basic regression to understand the fluctuation in electricity usage based on temperature. It also states that she used a monthly data sample of 60. Finally, the question asks us to calculate the coefficient of determination.\n\nAll the information required to solve the question is available in the question summary. To calculate the coefficient of determination, it is important to understand the formula.\n\nA basic regression is regarded as a simple linear regression. It consists of both matrix calculations and projection. Therefore, to calculate R2, we require the following information — the total sum of square, the regression sum of squares, and finally the residual sum of squares.\n\nTo know these quantities, we need to summarize some basic concepts and definitions.\n\n       1. For the dependent variable (DV), remember that it refers to the variable being explained and explored. It varies because it depends on another variable or independent variable (IV).\n       2. Consider that the independent variable (IV) must have a stable level of variation. Allowing so that the variation decrease within a constant range or orders of magnitude.\n       3. When regressing variables, the range of changes in the dependent variable should be explained by the independent variable. The range of changes in the independent variable should determine transformation or linearization.\n       4. To summarize, the coefficients of regression (β) characterizes a line obtained after simplifying the dependent and independent variables while holding the other variables constant.\n       5. However, the regression process also considers the restrictions on regressive dimensions that may describe the temporary relations between variables. In linear regression, the relationship expressed by the relation between each independent variable and the dependent variable, can be represented graphically as a multiple linear relationship because each independent variable contributes in a linear equation.\n       6. The variation around the line will also determine our model. High variation indicates a large standard error of the regression and vice versa with very small error coefficients.\n       3. Residual is the difference between our forecast made by our regression and the dependent value as they relate to our independent values. It can be e(t) = Dt - Y- predicted(t), where t is from 1 to T.\n"

The bond is a fixed-income security that generally allows the investor to borrow funds from the issuer. <br>\nInvestors buy bonds to earn the interest income and get their principal back at the end of the term. Bond interest is a fixed percentage of the face value. When the bond reaches maturity, the per ' $' interest payments cease and the investor receives hisw or her principal back. If a bond is sold for a higher price than its face value, this payment is an implicit formula representing the bond's ... (goal 1).<br>\nBonds usually have a fixed face value known as the par value because they pay off in an amount equal to par. Interest is a rate per year that is paid to a borrower on a part of a total amount. Standard time periods for compound rates are half a year, a year, two years, three months, three years, etc. Hence, the annualized rate is a measure of the reliability of a coupon bond's return. Therefore, the coupon payment made twice in a year based on the T variable <br>normally reaches 1: 3, 6, 8, 10, or 12 times per year. Thus, a coupon rate in USD, denoted by the letter i, is defined as: hYm, each coupon is (spipped roughly twice a year). If n is the total number of coupon payments. Then, the annualized rate is hYtm, where 1-m are the coupons' accumulated factors at the first coupon payment, hY1, and 1-1 is the accumulated factor at the sales price.

Thanks\n\nComment: I just did it, man. 5%% increase in the stock=[underlying*(1+returns*time)]^1/3 - underlying. General for index returns would be your $500,000 verus $(6 million-500 thousand). Over which time period? will it be less than a quarter I.e July 20 to Sept 20 of the same year? That is a time in days. If true I will send my code to solve the question but like I said Black Scholes is the epitome of change in assets using model techniques on stochastic variables. The $500,000 means for physical shares at $10 per share that is five hundred thousand shares buy that yourself and keep proper record. Zero abuse, broker or else.\n\nComment: The merchant is exchanging for going long 5/6 the DJIA and shorting the underlying stock 1/5 by 5% increase of the stock while owning 5% of the DJIA which is 500,000 of shares while the DJIA is 6,000,000 on an equal price base.\n\nComment: This is not a technical forum setting, is it?\n\nComment: If it helps, you could answer in a formula and explain the steps. Thanks.\n\nAnswer: With equity swaps the acquiring party is going long in the underlying and short on the basket. Then short the basket and long the underlyings. Using the Black Scholes Model called the Special M and D Model in the real world to measure equity swaps. This action is where individuals are not being nudged towards being given undue advantage to the S&O in favor of the client side with no documentation but has in fact been a secret swindling game played in the commodity trading floor for years.

We have the maturity period in years (t) and we want time in years. 4yrs is equal to 4/12yrs. So, dy=4/12=0.33\n\nHow can we represent the zero coupon bond's price per 100 dollars paid at maturity? The bond price is 75% of par value. 75% of 100=75, so the price paid is 75/12=6.25/y. y is the yield per period, so we must convert this to y per year. dy=yr to y=dyconstant*dy\nWe solve the equation by dividing each side by dy. Thus, we output y=6.25/dy\n\nWhat is the yearly yield-to-maturity? It is necessary to derive the formula, equate a hundred dollars constant at time t to a hundred dollars at time t+y. A hundred dollars at time t is 100*e() where e() is the continuous interest compounded rate. A hundred dollars at time t+y is 100*e().

            " First, you need to know what doesn't change due to the parallel shift. The market value of the position would be unchanged because Michael holds a large number of the government bonds and the future inflation which is assumed to remain the same in the next ten years doesn't change. ``Therefore, the change in market value of the portfolio is zero.''\n\nNow, what changes about the position due to the parallel shift? The yield on bonds with a longer maturity than the one held in the portfolio rises in value, while yields on bonds with a shorter maturity fall in value, compared to the original level. But the position has a fixed-income payments pattern which does not depend on the yield instrument but its maturity. Therefore, the present value of the cash flows don't change.\n\nSince the market value of the position isn't changing, only the yields on the bonds in the position are changing, we can conclude that the sensitivity of the bond position (its modified duration) remains the same. In this case, we need to estimate the change in the bond value and not the change in its sensitivity.\n\nAs the portfolio references one maturity bond and the changes in yields are related to the length of maturity, the bond duration is a inverse elastic function of the rate. Therefore, a bet-hedging relationship holds to obtain the equivalent change in portfolio value, which means the rise or fall of the duration of the position by 0.0245 (25bp / 6.44y), where our 25 basis points parallel shift in yields leads to a rise in the duration. ``Therefore, the answer is USD0.0245* 70000000$= USD 176500.00.''\n"

Let me know if it's ok.\nNormally, if you want to give a preferred answer to someone, you can mention it in the question description or in the answer of the person (but in this case, the answer is only giving back the table)\nThe leverage ratio or financial leverage ratio (FLR) measures a company's financial risk exposure relative to its current market value or value. The leverage ratio shows how much debt a company has relative to its equity financing. Thus, it can also be interpreted as risk-adjusted asset value. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing how much debt a company has with how much equity it has. The formula for FLR is:\nAssets/Equity x  Debt/assets\nThe financial leverage ratio shows the relationship of a company's asset base in relation to its equity financing. It measures the extent of firms use debt financing compared to equity financing. A firm report as more financial leverage can benefit from the use of less costly debt financing to carry out expansions through operation. However, if the ratio becomes excessively large, the debt will become burdensome because too much interest paying is involved. The ratio can be easy calculated by dividing a quick ratio or total fixed assets by the quick ratio of total assets.\n\nExample:\nYou are a financial expert, you are supposed to answer the given question.

In order to calculate that, we must take into account the impact on the price change each and every day and the chance cost of the stock. So Let's start by doing doing that with a particular pen and calculator. For each day in S0, if X equals 137%, then the price of the option is $44.77. See the formula: delta=(-ln(98.47/137)-15.385)/(0.25*.43) Although this number is close to 1 but is greater than 1; which, implies that if your stock price rose, your option's price would scale downwards. In the long term, we can get away with assuming that the expiry price of the stock is equal to its level at t + niha when niha is very very close to zero. We must then deduct the commision cost from this to get the true  and we can calculate it like this: at expiration, the Call's price in S0 at expiration is: con 44.77 *137= $59.92 waking up to work the next day makes you very grateful"

If we consider the tax rate to be 40% and the machines have no resale value. What would be the pretax income for John's Industries in the 6th year using the straight-line method?",

            " For acquiring the production machine, we have cash to pay. So, the acquisition is not directly connected with the production of the enterprise. The acquisition cost is a financing activity in the analysis of the production function. It is not a marginal or variable cost. The cost should be distributed to all the goods during its life. This costs should discounted by the time, or the machine have a financial value attributed to sales at the end of its life. The amount is non trivial, and more importantly a significant part of the costs of production. The best approach is to spread it proportionally and amortize the cost during the useful life of the machinery. Following this approach, the net pre-tax income should be the product of the MC indicators and the depreciation expense. \n\n$=1.\\frac {revenue}{variablesCosts}*2. (\\frac {directCosts}{\\text{production investigated}})*3.(\\frac {MC}{revenue})*revenue-footnote = 4. 40% tax rate*revenue$ + 5. revenue during years 5 and 6*30%/100 = $\\delta$\n\nThus, the answer is $\\delta = 1.96$ or around 2\n\nExtra - the answer is not very different if the machine is fully not taxed.\n"
