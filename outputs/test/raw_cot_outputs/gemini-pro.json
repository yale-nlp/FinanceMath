The offer from Peterson values Heartland at an enterprise worth of USD40.6 billion, which includes USD4.3 billion of existing Heartland debt. In order to finance the consideration of USD55 in cash along with 2.25 Peterson shares for each Heartland share, Peterson intends to issue 104 million new shares and will raise approximately USD26 billion in new debt, with the remaining being funded by cash on hand. Once the deal has closed, Peterson anticipates having an outstanding debt of nearly USD62 billion. Before the acquisition, Peterson had 1.096 billion shares in circulation, each trading at USD125. With the assumption of a constant share price and the book value of debt being equal to its market value, Jackson plans to ascertain the change in the proportions of debt and equity in Peterson’s capital structure following",

Adding this to the existing 50,000,000 common shares gives us a total of 54,000,000 potential common shares. Then, we need to add back the preferred dividends for the period to the net income. There are 2,000,000 preferred shares paying a dividend of $5 each, for a total of $10 million in preferred dividends each year. Adding this to the net income of $200 million gives us a total of $210 million. Finally, we can calculate the diluted EPS by dividing the total net income by the potential common shares outstanding. So, the diluted EPS would be $210 million / 54,000,000 shares = $3.89. Therefore, the answer is 3.89."

Since we are projecting a trailing P/E of 20 in 4 years, the terminal value is 20 x the earnings per share in year 4. The earnings per share in year 4 is given by the dividend in year 4 divided by (1 - the earnings retention ratio), which is $0.3461 / (1 - 0.6) = $0.86525. Therefore, the answer is 20 x $0.86525 = $17.3.\nTherefore, the answer is $17.3."

Since we know the expected standard deviations of each security and the correlation of returns between them, we can use the formula for covariance: Cov(1, 2) = Corr(1, 2)*Std(1)*Std(2) to find the covariance between returns of the two securities. Plugging in the values, we get: Cov(1, 2) = -0.15*0.20*0.20 = -0.006. Substituting this value, we get: Var(Portfolio) = 0.5*0.20^2 + 0.5*0.20^2 + 2*0.5*0.5*(-0.006) = 0.04 - 0.006 = 0.034.

Therefore, the pre-tax cost of debt is 8%*(1-40%)=4.8%. Secondly, each component cost is multiplied by its weight in the capital structure. Lastly, the weighted average of these costs is computed to arrive at the WACC. For debt, the weight is $100,000/$320,000 = 31.25%. For preferred stock, the weight is $20,000/$320,000 = 6.25%. For common stock, the weight is $200,000/$320,000 = 62.5%. The WACC is, therefore, (31.25%*4.8%) + (6.25%*10%) + (62.5%*12%)= 9.375%. Therefore, the answer is 9.375."

Marginal revenue is obtained by differentiating total revenue (TR) with respect to quantity (Q), and TR is calculated as P*Q. Substituting P = 165 - 3Q, we get TR = 165Q - 3Q^2. Thus, MR = dTR/dQ = 165 - 6Q. Setting MR = MC (1 + 10Q), we get 165 - 6Q = 1 + 10Q, which simplifies to Q = 16/16 = 1. Substituting Q = 1 back into the demand equation, we find P = 165 - 3(1) = 162.

The total construction cost in Euros should be converted to millions of dollars using the exchange rate at the appropriate time. Assuming the exchange rate is €1 = $1.14, the total construction cost in million dollars = €38.5 million x $1.14/€ = $43.77 million. Therefore, the answer is (43.77 - 5) / 40 = $0.97.

            "To determine the bond's price, we need to calculate the present value of its future cash flows. First, let's calculate the annual coupon payment: $1000 * 4% = $40. Next, we need to find the present value of these annual payments using the provided required rate of return (r) of 3.5%. Since the bond has a three-year maturity, we will have three annual coupon payments. Using the formula: Present Value = Coupon Payment / (1 + r)^n, where n represents the year of the coupon payment, we get:\nPV(Year 1) = $40 / (1 + 0.035)^1 = $38.60\nPV(Year 2) = $40 / (1 + 0.035)^2 = $37.25\nPV(Year 3) = $40 / (1 + 0.035)^3 = $35.95\nFinally, we add the present value of the principal, which is the par value:\nPV(Principal) = $1000 / (1 + 0.035)^3 = $906.92\nNow, we sum all the present values: $38.60 + $37.25 + $35.95 + $906.92 = $988.72.

            "We can use the spot and forward rates to calculate the implied yield on the 5-year bond. The implied yield is given by the formula: (1 + spot rate)^n = (1 + forward rate)^m, where n is the number of periods between the spot and forward rates, and m is the number of periods between the forward rate and the maturity of the 5-year bond. Plugging in the values, we get: (1 + 0.05)^2 = (1 + 0.06)^m. Solving for m, we get: m = 3. Therefore, the implied yield on the 5-year bond is 6%. The price of the 5-year bond can be calculated using the formula: Price = Face Value / (1 + yield)^n, where n is the number of periods to maturity. Plugging in the values, we get: Price = 100 / (1 + 0.06)^5. Evaluating the expression, we get: Price = 74.62. Therefore, the answer is 74.62."

Given a coupon rate of 5%, paid semi-annually, and a maturity of seven years, the number of coupon payments would be 2*7 = 14. To calculate the present value of the bond repayment, we can use the formula for present value of a future sum: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the face value of the bond (assumed to be 100), r is the market discount rate (3%), and n is the number of years to maturity. Using these values, we get the present value of the final payment as PV = 100 / (1 + 0.03)^7. To calculate the present value of the coupon payments, we can use the formula for each semi-annual coupon payment, 100 * 0.05 / 2, and then sum the present value of each coupon payment.

A year later, on January 1, 2020, the value of Jensen's European asset increased from EUR 50 million to EUR 54 million, having EUR 20 million in shares and EUR 34 million in bonds.

Similarly, find the value of the European bond portfolio on January 1, 2020 in USD: EUR 34 million x 1.16 USD/EUR = USD 39.44 million. Add the values for the European stock and bond portfolios in USD to get the total value of Jensen's European assets in USD: USD 23.2 million + USD 39.44 million = USD 62.64 million. Calculate the difference between the total asset value in USD on January 1, 2020 and the value on January 1, 2019: USD 62.64 million - USD 55 million = USD 7.64 million. Finally, calculate the rate of return by dividing the difference by the original value: (USD 7.64 million / USD 55 million) x 100 = 13.89%. Therefore, the answer is 13.89."

The total value of the stock can be approximated as the sum of the present values of the two stages. The present value formula is PV = D/(r-g) where D is the dividend receipt, r is the required return, and g is the growth rate.

We are given the expense as £20,000. We don't know the residual value or the useful life. However, we can eliminate the residual value by using the information from last year. We know that (Purchase value - Residual value) / Useful life in years from last year was: (£460,000 - £110,000) / 1 = £350,000. If we assume that the useful life is the same this year as it was last year, we can set the depreciation expenses equal: (£380,000 - Residual value) / 1 = £20,000. Solving for the residual value, we get: Residual value = £360,000. Substituting this into the equation (£380,000 - £360,000) / Useful life in years = £20,000, we can solve for the useful life in years: Useful life in years = 10. Therefore, the answer is 10."

            "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. In this case, the range is 10-1 = 9. To find the mean absolute deviation (MAD), we need to know the mean of the dataset. The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in the dataset. In this case, the mean is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)/10 = 5.5. The MAD is the average distance between each data point and the mean. To find the MAD, we need to calculate the absolute deviation of each data point from the mean. The absolute deviation is the distance between a data point and the mean, regardless of whether the distance is positive or negative. In this case, the absolute deviations are: |1 - 5.5| = 4.5, |2 - 5.5| = 3.5, |3 - 5.5| = 2.5, |4 - 5.5| = 1.5, |5 - 5.5| = 0.5, |6 - 5.5| = 0.5, |7 - 5.5| = 1.5, |8 - 5.5| = 2.5, |9 - 5.5| = 3.5, and |10 - 5.5| = 4.5. The MAD is the sum of all absolute deviations divided by the number of data points. In this case, the MAD is (4.5 + 3.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 4.5) / 10 = 2.5.
