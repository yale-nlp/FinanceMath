            "\n\nAs advised, first let's take a close look at what each return means. The numbers (8 6 3 2) indicate the return of each asset class  from 1 to n. So, equities has the highest return and has value 8, i.e. 8/1 = 8. Let's explain the decoding in brief. N is the last term in an arithmetic sequence. Since, n = 10 then let's assume it is the one which has the longest term in the sequence. 1 has the highest value and has a multiplier of 1. Now if you think a little further, yes, 2 has the first arithmetical term but actually it's not correct since 2 has the multiplier of 2. It should be 2.1 instead of 2. When this sequence  geometric sequence reaches a zero then this is the last of it and the capacity is used up (or reserves depleted). Why we use geometric sequence and then we use illogical zero multiplier? It is done to show the return is representative. To put more specifically an asset has a stated growth in value for instance p or more a year and so we take a non-standard approach of subtracting the Compound Growth Rate (r ) of the sequence  from the sequence to get 0. Motive for doing so? The goal is to present your returns in a way that you make visible all 'moments' of growth or loss to conceive the nature of them.\n\nFor CG unites in a geometric series which has a periodic difference d ( 2) from 1/r then the CG unit of the base is r. Let us take the CG unit of the base as r.\n\nCG from r is CG(r)=r. What is the value of r in financial markets?\nWe see from the distribution of returns 8, 6, 3, 2 that numeriously a number of lesser numbers form or aqueous compress in the area of apparent crimes of indices. Return of changes are very large. Few years ago, the equity market had a return of more than 50 percent. Assume the portfolio is aggrangate of the percentage of each asset. If the asset's time-weighted average return is 10 percent while the volatility is 90 percent and"

The price ratio is instituted to evaluate a company or a stock and can disclose its performance. In general, the higher PE implies higher stock value because the cash flow is a higher number in relation to price.  But the periodical growth of a company and analysts’ estimation may change the EPS. The estimated company growth rate improves the EPS in current period and decreases it in future period, because of which investors may take interest in that stock. When the estimated company growth rate is negative, that leads to a decrease in the stock price and its stock rating from analysts."

And we can simply calculate this from the data sheet, and then do the same in stock market. We can also assume a let's say \"mean value\" for a half a year. So we have Leverage Ratio=averaged over a half year period=xxxx*number in this data set/number of companies/2=xx. We can then do Step 2 with just that information.\n\n\\strong{Example 2:} Instead of this above formulation, assuming the interest rate follows the simple compound interest formula.

This also means we need to input the amount of time and interest rate.\n\n200*6 months/12*Simple Interest/6/1*5%=8.47\n(these are the components included in Step 2).\n\nThen do 200*6 months.clearly, we would like to get rid of the leverage ratio component, so dividing by holding period in stock market would be much easier than switching to last value and summing this with interest.

Here are the issues I predict are causing it:\n\nYou must keep the forward-deltas where they are. If you think about it, the next-predictions must be the same shape as the current shapes if you want the original output to remain consistent, and if you concatenate enough samples you can just add them right on the forward deltas. Here, you have a list that has to be in the same shape of the previous shapes which makes it work.\n\nSimilarly, you would want to concatenate the additional backwards samples at the end of the generated string of shapes.\n\nTwo issues interact here: a) There must be some gradient penalty for the loss flowering, something like the SGD recipe in TF except that you want the hyperparameter of the penalty/weight to grow as you explore the search space more rather than having the penalty essentially learning to skip the forward-deltas, and b) There should be a term that weights the loss flowering and the size of the decay based on the current step number you are at, weighing progressively more towards the decay as the step progresses.\n\nObviously those two things may be effecting the train/validation and awaiting training accuracy but correcting this in the backprop function should positively"

But as we are using a monthly compounding formula, we need to be aware that we need to work with a monthly measure not a daily one. So from the formula we ended up with 20 * 12 = 240, rated a 5/4. 5/4 = 20% * 12/100. That would mean that each month's interest is 20%/100.\n4.

We need to have 2 different information for other different inflation index numbers, just like 'Relative Price perceived' and 'All Price change'.\n\nSuppose a car which is the same one in 2011 but the price is relative 25% less, then the inflation is 'Relative Price' in this question?

            "\n\nStep I: we should know the background of the question.\n\nAnswer 1: the company purchased a customer list for $100,000, which is expected to provide equal annual benefits for the next 4 years. The cost may be fully expensed in 1 year or be amortized. If the cost may be fully expensed in 1 year, as it is long-lived in nature, it is more beneficial to expense the cost in 1 year. But, it requests to consider it as an intangible asset and to amortize the cost on that basis. Hence, the answer should be 'amortized'.\n\nAnswer 2: the company has recorded $200,000 of goodwill in the acquisition of a competitor. It is estimated that the acquisition would provide substantial benefits for the company for at least the next 10 years. Since it is a long-term benefit, it may be expensed in 2 years, or may be amortized over the life of the asset, i.e. 10 years. It is more appropriate to amortize the cost since it is hard to foresee the full benefit acquisition in 2 years. The amount of first year amortization and number of years to amortize the cost may be discussed below.．\n400,000 *20%=80,000\n80,000 *10=800,000\nHence, the answer should be 'amortized'.\n\nAnswer 3: the company spent $300,000 on media placements announcing the company had donated products and services to the community. The CEO believes the firm's reputation was enhanced substantially and the company will likely benefit from it for the next 5 years. Sure, donation will enhance the firm's reputation which leads to increased awareness and higher sales. If the disposition method does not require the recognition of income, the company may expense the cost immediately or amortize it over 5 years. Since the CEO thinks the donation will provide benefits for 5 years, we think that the amortization method is more suitable. Since there is no limitation on how long the benefit should be earned, long-lived benefit is acceptable."

Then put them together and we get the shoulders (€70-€90) and the head (€75-€70) are opposed. Then, it will be good to know BL to find the proceed sign. The answer depends on the height of €70 to €90. From the shoulders (€70-€90) we know the bottom pattern height is €30. And the proceed sign is indicated at (-€30). €30 is subtracted from €75, then we get the proceed sign of €45. The reason why it should be €45, the distance of €90-€75 (the base length of the head) is just 1.5 times of the distance of €70-€90 to reach the bottom base. Now, we know the proceed sign and the collar (€100), so the proceed investment is 45% of the original amount. And Investment = (proceed investment) * (neutral figure (€100)) = €45 * €100 = €4500. Therefore, the intended price is €71,000. Or also expressed by the CTAs, the original position is (€100, and then +€4500).\n\nOracle query language is used to write the above model.

You do realise the Fibonacci series is never complete - you use a series of 'n' values to solve one value to figure out the aforementioned formula.

So doing the calculation I got $7.45625.\nFinally, I want to convert the view to a directed normal form, so I put the value of a put in front of the calculation.\nI will do the final equation of $7.45625×$7.45625.\nThe answer is $53.1736 in total.\n\nso, my final pronouncement would be '$12.65 +$8.85 $53.1736'.⠀\n\nAnswer: From the options perspective, the question is \"How much can the strikes of the options be from the given ceiling strike $40, rupee floor strike $35 and tenor 20 days?\"\n\nThe options market exists because the \"real\" value of (some) options can move above the strike price. $^{\\circ}P_35 +  \\big( {C}_{\\large 40}- {P}_{\\large 35} \\big) \\big( {T}_{\\large 2} \\big)^2$; of course the given $^\\circ N_35$ is more than $ C_{\\large 40} - {P_35} $.\n\nAccording to Put-Call Parity, ${P}_{\\large 35} + {N}_{\\large 35}$ is  \\strong{\\em{bounded}} between ${C}_{\\large 40} - {P_35}"

            "\n:The answer is 7,000 dollars.\n1. To answer the question you first need to understand what is done by an examiner in the case of defaulted loans, so a simple duplicate test on the data table will let you see that the examiner proposes two scenarios of action. Both scenarios will be taken into account in the calculation.\n2. You are asked to calculate the value so the \"the answer is ...\" part should be a numeric value. It means you need to multiply the two percentages then get the total result.\n3. If we state that you use Java programming language the following code is more appropriate in my opinion :\n\nLet P1 and P2 the scenarios proposed by the examiner\n\n\\begin{code}\nP1% = 40; P2% = 60; nop2=60;//from problem description\n\ndouble sum=0.0;\n\nfor(int i =0; i< P1%; )\n    sum+=P2;\n\nfor(int i= 100; i>= nop2; i-=10)   //anything that can be done to simplify the problem\n    sum+= P2;}\n\nSystem.out.println(sum);  (The answer then)\n\\end{code}\n\nIn fact you will learn out that if you implement the proposed scenario of P1 with probability 40%, then, you will recover 50,000.\nThe total amount of recovery is then 100,000*50% = 50,000 + 50,000*40%*100,000).\nThe tax within the range is 60% and the total value will be 60,000 dollars.\nNow you can see that you can recover a total amount of 7,000 dollars.\n4. If the answer is not let's say 500 dollars you can assume wrong as your recovery rate will not be your total rights after taking into account all the relevant taxes in respect to the scenarios.  These recoveries provide the solutions to similar questions you can see always on this website.\n5.

We know that since the bank does comply with the Basel I Accord it has no income from the loan (because of the capital requirement), it is approximately safer than 99.6%. We also know that the risk weight of the leasing company is 50%.\nNow even if the leasing company would fail, the bank would need to pay the company back it's leasing, wich is worth approximately $50 million. So for half of the credit risk the bank had under Basel I the transfer value was 50 million, such that we get $25 million.\nThe risk weight of not loaning $ you lease but rather holding cash is a bit confusing, but according to the author it's 0%.\nWhich leaves us with a swap of $25 million at 0% and hold the full bank-holding $100 million on top of this until it matures at 0%.\n\nNow going back in one step it's easier, because the leasing company will pay back $25 million at maturity, and the building is worth $100 million, so by the end all $100 million are gone.\nIf we want to create a mathematical model for this we can take i.e. $100 million worth of some asset, disperse it <= $25 million before it's required (66,6...%). Then we have finally $100 million saved off-balance or 100% since then 100% off-balance = 100% on-balance.\nHowever if somebody tells us that $100 million worth of assets gets saved off-balance and nobody takes a look at the measurement... We have to base our thinking on a formal model to calculate the fundamental on-balance-sheet credit risk charge.\n\nComment: It's not clear if this is"

[Coupon rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_rate) is associated with the credit of the issuer. Taking into account the bond's initial value (100), the schedule of coupon payments for 10 years and the happening of the bond's eventual demotion, (suppose it drops from A+ to BBB-) you can easily calculate the projected yield.\n\nComment: How do you solve the last part of the question? How does a 1-grade demotion will result in the price of the bond to drop from its par value of $100 to a price below par? Can the rating system be that radical?\n\nComment: @m1f88, my understanding is that rating system does not take into account the issuing bank's ability to pay it to investors, it is focused solely on the chance of the default risk. Ratings reflect the how likely are other investors on the next market day to accept the buying those bonds, I think.\n\nComment: Hi @pmpepper, I think my use of word \"demotion\" was incorrect. A bond that is rated \"A+\" will not drop to \"AA-\" merely because the meting or in meeting of the Director of Moody agreed to drop the bond from \"AA+\" to \"AA-\".

Tax rate in your example is 25% so increasing in the first year the answer.\n4. In the end Firm B has a bigger decrease in the answer from step 2 which cancels out with the original increase in the answer in the first year.\nGoing from this it will be reasonable to say that Firm B return on equity before expenses is the same as Firm A return on equity before expenses. Once you have decided to expense the printer you have discarded the closing balance sheet. Although Firm B saved about the parties the answer will be the same because you cannot deduct any of the initial closing balance sheet value of Firm A to delete the printer that Firm B expensed.\nTechnically to make the columns in your first step in this example the required all years it should have the following columns:\n|                                   |  Current  |\n|                             Opening | Year 1  |\n| Beginning Net Income   | Net Income  | Beginning Balance Sheet |\n| Net Income Change       | Book Value  |  Opening Balance Sheet |\n| Deficit, Income Taxes   | Equity     |  Closing Balance Sheet   |\n**With this information and only one journal entry relevant to reporters it does not matter if one reports in step 2 as an intake or an outgoit in the year end balance sheet**.\nThe correct answer will always be the same ifwe ignore the closing balance sheet for Firm B and consider only the beginning and ending balance as shown in Step 2 of your example.\nHaving thus established it is true we just need to ask ourselves what the answer should be when we report the final balance sheet of Firm B or in other words really in order to know the return on equity we have to know the income before and after expenses and all transactions affecting the net income (tax and dividends but not repairs). If we had designed this example to follow the recommended steps of reporting we would have recorded five transactions affecting the income during the year and a 31 December closing balance.\nMy big conclusion here"

Few basic descriptions are listed as eye opener below.\n\\section{Linear Regression}\n\nLinear regression is a statistical method that identifies the relationship between two variables.\nIt helps to understand which factors might be positively or negatively related and which might have little or no effect on one another.\n\\section{Long-Term Correlation}\n\nFor investors, the long-term correlation of the two assets means that the future return of one asset will be linked to the future return of the other asset in a major way.\n\nThereafter long-term correlations is a reflection of how the two assets are intertwined in the long\nterm, and how their assets are inter dependent.\n\\section{Mean Reversion}\n\nFinally, you can typically observe historical data which shows that a particular price has previously done some period of time.\nThereafter the assumption goes back to the mean reversion whereby initial pricing is unreasonable and price must come back to \"normal equilibrium levels\". In other words, price must gradually return to its historical mean.\n\n\\section{Fast Moving Average (FAMA)}\n\nMathematically we can present the mean reversions rates w.r.t. FAMA.\nFAMA as shown above is the average of both positive and negative values AND create a single average of returned values."

We formulate the economic value of investments in stocks with market value equal to the lesser of the premium and current price x share by the market value of the investment, where for fixed-income investments the market value is the par value.\n\n[0000003e]\nFig. 001-2: Market value (=cost) for Investment in stock[0000003f]\n\nIt appears that the carrying value of the equity instruments with the fair value below the carrying value or the dividend paying investments shall be specified. But the carrying value of the instruments equals the par value (we do not need to consider the premium). So we calculate the market value = cost, which equals half the difference between the par value and the current price. Thus we come to market value = par value – cost\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Considering the nondividend-paying investments:\nThe general rule is the carrying value of nondividend-paying investments equals the market value (COY).[60: 65]\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Goal for the initial calculation:  aim for  carrying value = market value; otherwise, Variation of COY:  filling denominator with numerator, Doing that we come to COY = 1"

Lopez kick-starts the conversation by requesting a recap on fundamental CDS principles and parameters. McQueen responds by explaining that a CDS comprises both a premium leg and a payment leg and that anticipated loss forms one of the elements that impact its valuation. McQueen provides data for a bond issued by Zeus Corporation. According to the facts presented in Exhibit 1, what is the forecasted loss for the Zeus Corporation bond?",

            "\n\nHere let's be super strict. Let's assume interest rates are at 0% today, hence the coupon is sufficient.\n\nI. Suppose I buy a 6% coupon bond, so the yield is the coupon*100 divided by the par amount = 60. That can yield whatever p.a. (but if the yield is less than 0.06 then the p.a. is negative). Before 10 years, I receive interest of less than 0.6 (don't care that I get something, not 0.6, it can be negative). Suppose I hold for 10 years. I get 10 years interest at the 60*20 (total_interest= 6(10)-60*.5 = 11.05), at the end I receive 1000*(10.15=.1015) = $101.5. Since the price is $1000, the gain is $5.5.\n\nII. Let's say I hold for too long, past 10 years. I receive 10 years = 60*20 = 120, it's less than the 720 that was at the current setting. Same reason, at the end I receive 120*(10.15/120)*1=10.395. The gain turns to -12.55  which is negative.\n\nIs there someone have done this simulation but in a more detailed way, since I will not do this like this.\n\nIs there potential for disruption if past mistakes could somehow be included.\n\nSimulation is more on the business, since BT Topics #10, 25, 40 only ask for application.\n\nComment: If you are a financial expert, then how come this question looks like it's asking for a step-by-step process, instead of the method to get to a solution? _How should I get to the answer_?\n\nComment: @Daniel123 please see this for some deadlines requirements, which include questions https://italian.online.ku.dk/studieopleve/deadlines/, and please check this guide here https://bazeleveryday.com/ for"

From the perspectives of Shareholders, the value of the dividend per share is smaller' so we can solve the following equation: $1/0.8*1.5+1*0.6=($1/0.8*1.5+1$)/0.6*$16.5=$12 When we solve equation, we can see that the dividend per share amounts to 1\nfor year 1, and 12 for year 2.

And we know what these three letters mean.\n2) What are we missing information?How much is the capital loss the investment will suffer if the asset does not met the strike rate (110). The volatility of the asset that is the option yield will rely on this information.\n3) Where do we find an estimate of the volatility? The market data for the asset is not available. (Classical volatility is the volatility of the asset at the date of the transaction of the asset. It is however not relevant).\n4) A call options is option that reap the maximum gain (the step function). A put options reap the minimum gain (similarly). The two get mixed up in the minds of the students. A call option works as follows, we invest N(d) and buy a call option for a share rewards system with a strike rate of S if and only if StrikeRate : ‎>‎ Drawnate (meaning the asset benefit price goes up). If it does not make any difference we have no call option (unintelligent funds). If it matters then we have a call option. But if the price drop too much we will actuate the put option instead of nurturing the call option. Here comes the real problem. You don't want to reap the bow if you put the put option. But you still invest the fixed N(d) in the first case. Trader clas\n\n5) - From DBS we know that the Black-Scholes model needs three input variables. From the professor, we are told the BlackScholes model assumes they are connected to zero (correct).

This is not the fastest way. Please read [here](https://pypi.org/project/paraman/index.html) for hints how to load the code into python3 and exploit multithreading to for an improvement by a factor of, say, 100. If the fit fails after 100 runs break it off: at right gaps there will be no improvement. If you give me the name of the fit engine you used, I could explain more."

            "\nThe first let's do the bond clean price calculation: there's no interest. But what do I need to take into account that? I need to take into account coupons dates. There's no accrued interest... So clean price = $1000.\nSecond, what happened from clean price to dirty price? I need to take into account accrued interest.What is accrued interest? Accrued interest is 35.50/100 (or 8/100), because I made $1000$ and i got $35.50 \\\\because there were 8 coupons. But what is 35.50 /100?. $35.50, but it is in 100 cents, not in 100 dollars. In addition, I am getting 35.5 dollars not 35.50. I had to take a one oft hese two.\n\nAnswer: If you want to get a numeric value $price$, you could use something like this:\n\n$price = ($end_clean+accrued_interest)*(100 - 100/(1.07)^(1/8))/1.07; $\n\nThe 100 is $1000$, the 1.07 is $1.07 as the interest deposited by insurer is 7 cents for every dollar. The code itself... judging by the 8 we will get 2 coupons, meaning 1.07^8=1.007 which gives no result in 100 as the result would be over 100. That is why I added 1 to bi-product ($1.07^8$). We can put in $25.50/1.07^8$ in a way it provides ${2.07^8=108.07}$ divided by 1.07. Notice that the result is in 100% so we have to divide from top ($1.07^8=1.07$).

            " What is a bond equivalent yield, what is it useful for and how is it related to a YTM? First of all, we need to know what YTM is, if we know what it is, then we can easily learn what Bond Equivalent yield is.\n\nWhat bond yield (YTM) means — once the term by term currency yields of each year are rotated forward to the time closest to the destination date, and to the single cashflow (equivalent par value) per year, results in a yearly total continuous yield indication for the entire set of payment\n\nIf these yields are continuous so for a single payment in dollar value in the first year, the YTM will be the same if you were to repeatedly discount the nominal yearly price of the bond throughout its duration to the currently priced instrument. Calculating a bond’s yield-to-maturity (or the conversational version of its return or yield) is one of the most common calculations in fixed income investments. This yield is a good forecaster of real returns and should be employed in all aspects of bond valuation and purchasing decisions. By fixing the actual cash flows and swapping the rates to the destination date, the yield-to-maturity (YTM) becomes the equivalent yield to reference for the majority of assessments.\n\n\\strong{Solution:}\nLet's assume that N is the 'yearly-payment bond' with a face value of \\$100 at par, let's assume that K is the constant annual coupon, K = \\$5, let's assume 90 as the maturity year then we can use simple mathematics to answer our question.\n\nAssuming the current interest rate without sign is IR, we can run the convolution. ==> YR = \\$(1 + IR)^ - \\dfrac {90} {100} \\times -5 \\times \\$100 => YR \\dagger = \\$87.10458\n\nTherefore, YTM = 87.10458 / 100 = 0.8710458, therefor, the correct answer is \\{0.8710458,8710458)\\}.\n\nThen we can calculate the number of years for the bond namely:\n\n\\$100 / 0."

Considering X is happening or not happening entirely is not adequate for our case, this is because we are concerned about the events which is created and put on expected state once the condition of X happens because of the topic which we have explored. So, for example, if I am going to win a lottery I would do it because I am doing it under a condition that I will dress as a bear if I'm going to win it!\n\nIn mathematical terms it looks like this:\nLet us define a random variable Y which tells us whether X = Y, denotes our event X and Y allows us to create a small number of possible configurations given X:\n$$ P(Y = y) $$\nNow, defining a proportion of X to Y as follows:\n$$ p = \\frac{P(X = Y)}{P(Y = y)} $$\n$$ p' = \\frac{P(Y = y_{1})}{P(Y = y_{2})} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ p = p'\\frac{p_{1}p'_{1}}{p_{2}} $$\n$$ p = \\frac{14 \\frac{(\\frac{{{p_1}}}{\\mbox{$p_1$}})}{(\\frac{{{p_2}}}{\\mbox{$p_2$}})}}{14 \\frac{(\\frac{{{p_1}}}{\\mbox{$p_1$}})}{(\\frac{{{p_2}}}{\\mbox{$p_2$}})}}\\frac{p_{1}p'_{1}}{p_{2}} $$\nTherefore,\n$$ p = \\frac{x}{14}$$\n$$ 14\\% = x $$\nThe only question remains now is what event Y is? It is the reverse condition of event X: we are concerned about the possibilities of thing which doesn’t happen according to the expectations of event X (that is, when event X, condition Y is not extinguished).\n\nTherefore the answer for our given question is:\n1.\tThe answer: $14\\% = the chance of $ X is = probability of"

            "\nSince the customer bought this bond at face value, it won't change the cost of this specific bond even though it is sold at the close the 5th year. For the interest, if you use the daycount method, your are just going to count the remaining months in the 5th year. With 365 days in a year (as usual, just because it could be different), there are 178 days in the 5th year. So if you receive the one time 8% interest for 1 year, it will be 4% (8% * 178/1000) in that 5th year. Therefore, if you sell the bond at the close of the 5th year, you are going to get the principal together with 4% of the original amount. If you consider using the ahead column model, the exercise is similar. Since this is a 6 years bond, it is due in 6 years, no matter you decide to sell it or not because even if you sell it, you can receive the principal and interest within 1 year from the 'due date'.\n\nAnswer: In order to answer this correctly, you have to understand what it means to disburse interest once a year and then determine its impact on answers for the following years.

The question is asking about financing for 60 calendar days ahead.\n\n2. From the question, I know that \"life of the government bond\" is equal to \"60 calendar days ahead.\"\n\n\\begin{pre}\nE.g\n•If the life of the government bond is 365 days, then the discount rate changes on each day.\n•  On a specific day, usage of the bond depends on its price and its maturity date.\n•  If the bond matures tomorrow, then current discount rate is 97.63% on this day.\n•  However, if the bond expires 60 days from today, then current discount rate is 97.63% on this day.\n•  But if the bond expires 59 days from today, then current discount rate is 97.62% on this day.\n•  But if the bond expires 60 days from today, then current discount rate is 97.63% on this day (the maturity date of the bond).\n\n•  Therefore, the answer is 97.63%.\n\nIf any part of answer above is unclear or missing, please tell me.\n\\end{pre}\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: This is basically just a code dump!

Also, it has bonds of a face value of $10 million that will mature in five years and these bonds have an 8% coupon with payments every 6 months (Mean we need to add +8% starting from 1 year -> we have the total 13.65 %), and are calculated to yield 13.65 percent (Risk Free + Predicted Market Return).\n\n(3).

            "\n\nStep 1. financial: -5.3% + -5.5% + -2.8% = 12.4%; 12.4%/1.54%*100% = 81.1%\ntherefore, the answer is 81.1%.\n\nI wonder why the answer printed out like this: 81.1025525111704%.\n\nAnswer: According to documentation, `-1 %` corresponds with `0.99999999997` and `-0.1 %` corresponds with `0.99999999996`...\nSo when your final output is around `0.81`, it's something like `0.810255`, except truncated. BTW for the answer you should look more closely to documentation, the answer `81.1025%`.\n\nThen here you are: `81.1025/1.0025` = `81.1%`\n\nAnswer: `-2.8` and `-0.1` in the equation means that Peterson account achieved minus 0.1% on both return comparing to market benchmark or minus 2.8% since return benchmark in that account is -5.5% (so -2.8% since benchmark). because the result equates to -2.8% the model will round the result to minus two decimal places."

The remaining businessses therefore dont posses a scanner.\n\nThen, 65% of businessses with at least one scanner is 15.7% of businessses. So we can’t make more than 15% of the businessses scan (8 businessses as your question refers to).\n\nWhile fiveso in our sample can be scanned (5/8 = 62.5%), we have used 100% (or 1) to simulate that all are, and get higher than 15% possible result.

The given figure is the return of capital, interest, dividend and sale proceed. The market cost of the preferred stock returns all these, investors will be happy with this temporary rate of returns and will be waiting for more.\n$30 is the already attained return. In the future if the rate of return exceeds the existing rate of return then all the investors who have purchased the preferred stock share will sell their stock. Hence, there will be a drop in the existing rate of return.\n\nStep 2\nThe preferred stock is issued at the par value of 50$. This amount must not be mentioned in the question because the preferred stock is already issued and the 50$ was returned to the company which in return considers the investors safe to grow at 3.8%.\n\n$30 is an existing rate because the preferred stock is not offered at this rate. If the company wants to offer the preferred stock at the market cost of 30$ then the company must return the par value of 50$. The company will not offer the preferred stock at the fixed price of 30$. The company will not want to charge its investors short of the demanded cost because 30$ is the respectable cost at which it is expected. The cost of the preferred stock is expected to be the costable price. If the company offers at the higher rate it shall return the 50$ to its share holders prior to the issue of the preferred stock.\nWith the least expectation of a 3.8% return, the share holders of Company N will feel safe with the $30/$50 at their hands.\n\nStep 3\n\nNow, coming to the calculations I believe the market cost of the preferred shares of Company N is $30$/share.

The standard error of our final result will tell us.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: Where do we get the number 5 ? is it given that the data set has same number of data set elements as its mean ?\n\nComment: @abhitalks I think you're correct, but need to find reference/explanations.. please explain in your answer. thanks.\n\nComment: This is just the standard *deviation*. Everyday calculator, we calculate std dev., now as compared to the mean we can say that the std dev. is the square of the standard error...\n\nComment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error\n\nAnswer: I don't know where you learned about std. dev. but it is not the standard error.  There are many more points that can be on a graph instead of the mean. A number of standard deviation from the mean would be 5 as an answer i think..\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item To find the standard error you divide the standard deviation, generally of the size of the standard deviation (divide by ) so if standard deviation was 15 only then the standard error would be 15.\n\\item The standard error tells you that how far you can be or sometimes you will use it to find the minimum or maximum values. If your standard error is less then  the number is going to be 10 in the data set (because that's the closest number to 8), if your standard error is 5 the number can be in the range like 9 to 11.."

            "\n\nThere are a lot of steps here, but it will be much easier once you learn the concept.\nStarting Margin: is the amount of money a traditional, who does not have margin enabled, is supposed to put on account before they trade futures contracts. In this case, the starting margin is USD 3 200. That means it has a value of 1 480 000 units of price. The starting margin represents security because the trader will never risk the total sum of their local account. It is recommended that the broker requires no more than 20% of the contracted volume as a starting margin. If you operate with starting margin of 3200, it means you need 89000 (3200 * 26).\n\nDay Price changes per contract = -13,726 units of price.\nValue of contract = 100 units of goods.\nValue of the futures contract = 13 726 units of price.\n\nLet's imagine this as an example. You set up the value of your regular account in the broker to 890 000 units of price. You define starting margin as 3200 units of price. Then you entered a market buy at 14 000 units of price. If you have margin enabled, and you have 1000 units of margin, you may want to try to place a short stance against the market at 13 726 units of price on the first day. The day price must decrease by much more than the starting margin. In our example, it was -13 726 units of price.\n\nTherefore, the day price after one day of trading is 11 274 units of price. Let's imagine that it's just ten contract units here. That is the value of 100 units of goods after one day.\nYou need to calculate the variation margin now, because margin is an insurance against the market. Imagine in a more severe case - if the day price would have decreased only 5 826. Your stance value becomes unprofitable. Because your day price decreased -18 362 units of price, you need to actually provide a better balance, to bring your margin back up"

Calculate this: 25.00 + 2.00 = 27.00 First the starting price need to be calculated: 25.00 + 1.00 So total starting price = 26.00 The end starting price need to be calculated too 25.00 + 1.00 = 26.00 Now the gap price for capital gain is the result of capital gain * starting price - the result is 1.00 * 9.00 =========>10.00 Or €$10,000,000.

Cash is money banked on a bank account and so is marketable securities? Those are stocks and bonds.\n2. Let's forget about capital stock at this moment as it's a closing stock and a going concern assumption is violated.\n3. We know there must be inflows that will encourage the firm to open capital stock in order to invest in the market, this means if there have €1,200 liabilities then free cash flow must have in at least €600 (calculation)\nand so we require - (1,200-600)*0.6 = €100 of positive FCF to have a positive equity.\n4. We know that the end total cash must exactly equal to the change of total assets as we don't know of any in-flow-outflow but if the change of total cash is this big then the total cash must equal to the amount of change of total assets by the closing of year or rather the banking cycle (assuming money just involves cash) as borrowing is a long-term affair.\n5. So we do the calculation like this:\n(1,200-600) – (700-1,200)*3/12= – €100 right?\nThe change of total assets can be represented by the equity exchanged. The change of equity gives you the net equity transfer so, in fact, €100 is the worth of net equity transfer. Net equity transfer means the equity must switch hands from owners to creditors. The owners get what they owe to the creditors of the firm (the same meaning of interest) hence measuring Net equity transfer gives you a perspective of how much owners' equity increases of decreases.\n6. Therefore, the change of owners equity (the net equity transfer) is - €100\n7.

When we puchase protective put, the payout when market goes down is only its strike price, but the loss will be more than that because we have to pay the strike price for the protective put. In other word, the loss will be the premium*strike price. The quantity of loss in our case is $1.8*25.1=$45.20. So if the security price can cover the loss we can hold the protective put. When the strike price is close with the security price, we do not want to cover the loss.\n\n3.Full answer\nSince, in our case premium*strike price is more than the market price of stock, therefore, we do not want to cover it. But if the market price is larger than $25.1, then we will cover the loss because we can make money by selling the stock only. Therefore, the maximum loss is the minimum $25.1 minus the market price.

To do this he utilizes earnings data from the first quarter of 20X8 to the last quarter of 20X8 as examples to create an AR(1) model. However, he discovers that the autocorrelations of the residuals indicate a significant, strong seasonal autocorrelation. Johnson then adjusts the model to obtain the new equation, which is Xt=126.7537+0.1387Xt−1+0.9324Xt−4X_t=126.7537+0.1387X_{t-1}+0.9324X_{t-4}Xt​=126.7537+0.1387Xt−1​+0.9324Xt−4​.

            " So, 1. we need to calculate value of Xt following XAR equation  using statistical formulas already provided in the grading guidelines and earlier thought assignment.\n\n2. We need to forecast value of Xt, means value corresponding to month of 20X9. Something we need to do to forecast, because data for all months apart from current month is unknown; hence we need to use pattern to forecast or ansestate forecast based on prior quarters' data only. So, based on our new XAR(1) model\n\nXt=126.7537+0.1387Xt−1+0.9324Xt−4\n\neither by excel using excel functions like prediction or performing manual regression on existing data (we'll do in s ppinder response as shown).

Now let's calculate average from 5, 101+122+128+102+117/5 = 103, and now let's calculate 103/5 = average reduce from 20X8 and substitute in values of Xt given in above Excel output to produce temp reference monthly output of 20X9 as 109, 129, 135, 109 and 120. So, difference between them is, 120-109 = 11, 135-122 = 13, 128-122 = 6, 121-117 = 4...... So, 11+13+6 +4 = 34, 13-10 = 3, so difference between average and actual is 34. That average can be used for actual monthly output given existing data Xt and filling Xm as 120, 135....., 123, 126 ... etc.\nSo, final average sales"

            "\nSteps taken:\nWe need to know the company's methods of accounting for inventories. By analyzing the company's cash flow statement, we got the last in, first out (LIFO) method. LIFO is the method followed by the company for redetermining the inventory (for your information FIFO is the firs first out method).\nNow, we need to take into account the adjustment required to make FIFO and LIFO accounts mathematically equivalent and historically equivalent. Someone must have updated FIFO since LIFO is the standard and LIFO will be used in the financial statements.\nSo, we need to find out this update. The update was posted in a media circular dated 4/1/2005.\nNow, we need to know the state of the company's inventory on 31st December, 2005 since at that time, the company was going to switch the LIFO method to FIFO starting the next year. We can apply the assumption that the inventory on that date will not be changed.\nSo, using FIFO method, additional inventory to be recorded as on 31st December, 2005 will be 6000000.\nThen we need to apply the average 30% tax rate discount, the proper way. Now the value of LIFO reserve and the inventory will be adjusted to bring them into the FIFO method. So, FIFO inventory will be given as \"525,000\" dollars.\nSo, returning to the original inventory of 500000 dollars (30% tax rate),the adjusted gross inventory will be 525000 dollars. Now, we have obtained the original answer of \"Therefore, the answer is 525000 dollars\"\n\nComment: 1) Your subject line says \"problem statement\", yet your title says \"question\".

In this case, Macaulay duration is the number of periods between the last coupon-payment date and the payment date, measured in the time that the bond trades in the secondary market. Apple Corporation sold a $100 coupon that pays annually and matures in nine years. The face value of each coupon payment is $10 and is discounted to the trade date using the same spot rate. The sell price of the bond is $477.50, and the number of trading days since its issue date is 335.

It is hard to understand your question. Do you mean price of a bond ?\n\nAnswer: So as you mention you are to get the answer in a \"final sentence\". So first you need the formula to get the daily rate of 6% that year, assuming the bonds are first coupon, then it's \\em{$p = rn(r*a)/a$}\nWhere p is the price of the bond, this is simple an equation of a straight line. If you assume that from day 47 you do not include the first-interest rate, then you calculate the accrued interest as `i = r*47/360` You then apply the formula above to find the price you start with `p = $600.632` and using the formula above continually spread your interest charge over the remaining period (`i = $41.343`). At that point `p = 701.96`easy!\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n47 = no of days in 1 yr.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWrite your code."

OK, thanks.\n\nAnswer: Try to practice high school algebra to write down a precise expression and solve it afterwards. Means use variables for each side of your equation, try to write down explicit formulae and moreover try to use systems of equations in order to reduce the right side and finally after doing all that, solve it by likely software like this:\nhttps://www.desmos.com/calculator\n\nAnswer: With high school algebra, you can solve this problem. Model all possibilities of the client's order, where the order is $10$ if $Y$ does not increase, $30 + 10$ if $Y$ does increase, where $10$ represents the amount the order did not increase, if that happens of course and $30$ is the increase from the initial order size. That's the $10 / 30$ simplifying multiplication because the equation checks if $Y$ does not increase or increase. By the system, 10 %. Because $Y$ keeps its value does not increase, $X$ grows fairly in numerical value, but by the fractional 0.20 it does not grow very much. allegorically, that is increasing very little.

            "\n\n1-First you notice that the answer is supposed to be numeric, and for this(I guess?) you have to make an equation taking as variables the alpha and beta numbers(outputted by the system). Those are basic numbers. There are the assumptions: the answer is static/frozen, annualized volatility increases by the square root of time and there are 252 trading days in a year. Using that, you can rely on the fixed equation; so you don't have to keep the equation here in the stand but you must look at the answer inputs and the intermediate steps such as the 'ln of the daily variance ' and ...\n\n2-ly, you got the  SUM(ltn vai=ality)= A  AND, secondly,  Vi=ality =  a1*vai=ality^2+a2*vai=ality+a3*(daily variance)^2  AND, thirdly, then,=>  What is A? Don't forget that the sum is suppressed, then proceed using the equation as a guide. The safety point is the fact that the equation is automatically correct (you don't have to collect letters or letters and symbols; they just match) so it is easy to input it as a manual, save much more time and correct the output, only based on the output.\n\n3-Like that you get the answer expression and now you must put it in your system, know the mean function and the variance function, so that you just get the final answer that you must input in the final step."

Let’s start by calculating the standard deviation for this portfolio.\n\n3. Recall that for a random variable that follows a probability distribution, the following\nP, σ, and Z‐value\n\n\\begin{code}\nP(p) = ∫p^q(p)dp\nσ≡ E[X^2]\nZ ≡ (p - σ)σ/2\n\\end{code}\n\nσ is usually approximated by the following formula.\n\n4. For security constants d and e:\n\n\\begin{code}\nσ ≈ dσd + eσe\ndσd = E[(1 - d^n)^d] / E[1^n]\neσe = E[(1 - e^n)^e] / E[1^n]\n\\end{code}\n\n5.\n\n\\begin{code}\nσ ≈ ∑n 0 ∞ 1 ÷ n / n\nσ ≈ ∑ 0 ∞ 1 ÷ n / e\nσ ≈ π über_{| 0 ∞} 0 1 / n\nσ ≈ si.embarrac πsi.embarrac 0 1 / n\n\\end{code}\n\n6. The daily variance is estimated by the following formula:\n\n\\begin{code}\nσd = 250 * 0.40\nσd ≈ 143\n\\end{code}\n\n7. The standard deviation of this portfolio is estimated by the"

            " You should consider the expected inflation first because it is the most important concept. Otherwise, the expected return on the market index and government bond is lower than 10% and short-term return is higher than 7%. Now, the question can be along as follows:\n\nhow do we find erp=t as a function of the expected inflation, ei ?\n\nHere, e1 is 1.9% and e0 is 9.96%. Because of that, the rule above tells the following.\n\nt= exp (+0.067 e1 +- 0.067 e0)\n\nAs you expected, ERP is 1.27%.\n\nComment: In the first sentence, compute for ERP not for \"Historical ...\", and send both of them in a single sentence.  With regard to the second question, actually it might point out the assumption 'at least one of that expectation is specific'. Because when the situation is unexpected, the inflation expectation is rather low (e.g. e0<e1), then it might cause t>1 year, t=60.4% in this case.  In generalisation, we can just say, 'T is equal to the multiplied of e0 if e1 is positive, else it is equal to the multiplied of e1 if e0 is positive, else it equals to multiply the inverse of e0 and e1'\n\nAnswer: The Historical required return relates to how investors/speculators expect future returns on their investments (growth/income dividends, sometimes due to their risk of joining the investment). If for example, the future growth rate is negligible, and interest rates are low, then the price of equities may be seen as too high for future investors - and this or other stimuli (e.g. the economic situation) might cause this to change (rising inflation or better sure-bet options) leading to a price correction of equities (falling stock values), which may result in an investor buying other inflation-proof items such as commodities (e.g. farmland) to safeguard their investment (getting more money out of it). In this case the investor may want to get the price to equal the cost/capital outlay (depreciation) when purchasing"

The interest rates under Panel A and the interest rates under Panel B are almost the same. The only difference is that the × 3 Number after the column is in Pane A is -30, and in Panel B is +30. But the numbers are different just because is the minus.\n    For an integer number N and a positive number Ks. if N = 0, and if N is larger than Ks, then -N. Thus,\nOne of the bond's last 3 years is in year 0. And Panel A treats year 0 as if not year 0. So the number in the × 3 column after Panel A is actually 1 - 30 = -30. And Panel B treats year 0 as if it were the last year. Thus, the number in the × 3 column after Panel B is 30.\n\nSo when we analyze Panel A interest rate table, the price at year 0 is 89.283 (the price in the column before column 6, where doi has been omitted). However, we know that is 89.281 (the price in the column before column 16, where is correctly annotated as the price). Thus, 89.283 = 89.281 * (1 - 30), or for this case, 1.271. More importantly, we see from here that price negatively correlates with the interest rate. Since anti-cmption will likely advance with higher interest rates, but in general, for whoever borrows money whether it is the Government or corporation, price always declines with higher interest rate. Therefore, we know from here that there will be an inverse correlation between the price of the bond.\n\nNow, we analyze Panel B interest rate table. The price at year 0, column 31, is 89.352. But from Column 30, where the price is corrected to 89.352 * 1.271, we conclude that"

'expecting sales in December', it mainly means the toy was on sale in December. The actual price was $10 dollars when I checked, but the transaction record shows $15, it seems it was on sale items. The problem clearly states the two units are purchased at the same time. So the problem include the sales in November.

In other words, a 150-day term has annual interest rate of 5.62%. 2) Let's say that bond was initially issued with $1000 par value which means initial cost of investment is $1000 (Par value - discount factor). 3) Ok, now we need to answer this question that how much additional impoundment is required to pay all interest due to bank by end of each successive period and payoff principal by maturity (end of 150 day). 4) Lets say that, if the aggregate interest due is only $1000 per period then it is not enough to pay this sum throughout the whole year. How much additional amount is required? the answer is $62. If this additional amount = $62 then we can create a sufficient impoundment using simple arithmetic progression plus first initial amount we were talking about in starting ($1000+$62=$1062). 5) Next, let's determine how much additional amount is required when the aggregate interest due becomes $1200 (half amount of the first case). The answer is $112. And, lets find out how much additional amount will required when the aggregate interest is due becomes $2000. The answer is $274. The logic you have learned in this exercise is as follows: If the aggregate interest due over the impoundment period is $b, then the impoundment amount per period required is $b+a. So, based on our case we need $1500 - $1200=300. 6) Based on $300 Of additional impoundment required per period it will require a total impoundment $1500. In other words, bond's carrying amount will be $1600: 1062(DiscountFactor]+300[=(\"1000\"*((5.62/1.0562)^(1/360))+300)]) 7) Based on this carrying amount, using the information provided in Q1, we can calculate bond equivalent yield (or usually call it just"

SO, considering all thier, can you help to clear some doubts?\n\nAnswer: $RC^2$ is the annual growth rate from year 1 to year 5. Assuming there is a straight line leave this as is.\n\n$DV^2$ is the annual growth rate from year 1 to year 2. That is, the yearly compounded rate...\n\nAs you increase the years, that rate of return will approach 0, therefore, it should be somewhere around 0 and close to 0 both not exactly 0.

The formula for WACC is\nWACC = (Rd + Rp/E)*(1-T) where,\nRd= Senior Debt Rate\nRp/E = Equity Risk Premium or Subsidy\nT=Tax rate\n\nThe weighted average cost is usually calculated as weighted average of individual cost of capital for each debt and equity. We can use the information shown in the exhibit for average rates (interest and premium) and weights to calculate weighted cost of capital. After deriving weighted cost of capital, we can calculate margins.\n\n1. Weighted cost of capital = $4.9049*0.18 + 5.2400*0.82 = 7.2166\n\n2.

Example: say that Preferred Stock Value is equal to 300 thats means that investor will get 16% on this stock. if Debt have to 1200 Investor will get 14% on this stock and common stock should be 5400 to get 20% return.

Given that the credit loss probability is pr (default risk), and recovery rate is 60% and 50% for the two bonds respectively, we can acquire some insights on this question. Firstly, the assortment is composed of two bonds, thus the initial loss is prD= to individual bond, while final loss =(2(1(1-cv) + 204(p0v*prrp) * 60%), 2(1(1-cv) + 204*50%). (p0v means the recoverable loss ratio of each bond, 1-p0v = 1-prp). For the two bonds, the total loss for the whole year is 2(prx*prp) * p0v + 204*pryp * prrp. The contribution ratio of each bond is (prx*prp) + 204*pryp * prrp, thus the annual bond loss of one bond is determined by its (prx*prp) contribution factor, recoverable ratio of this bond is prx/(prx*prp) thus the loss charged-off in the first year of default is =prx/(prx*prp) * fixed loss.

Note that sales price is per share that you pay plus the dividend that you get per share.\n\nYour forcast is that the company may pay the same dividend forever and does not grow revenue.\nThis means you know the growth for the company. Since the dividend is payed to the shareholders there shareholders should get part of the growth. For the sake of arguments you say the shareholders get $6.60 per share growth in addition to the dividend.\n\nSo based on the answers to the previous 2 questions, you get $23 (market price per share) * 10 (times you get growth 1 year) * 0.65 (dividend per share) = $1615, whereas the price of the preferred stock is $880. Therefore, the required rate of return (the price minus the cash flow) is $880 - $1615 = -$735.\n\nSo the only question is if you multiply the growth by the growth, does growth always increase or decrease?\nThis being an accounting class you should know the answer, you should know how to put everything together to anwser the question.\n\nAnswer: It's just the required return = Computation Capitalization Ratio (P/R-BV)\n\nCode:\n\nDefreal = 0\n\nFor i = 1 to di\n\nDefreal[i] = Value of dividend[i] / Price of present stock / Different equity assumption\n\nClear out value of numerical answer\n\nSet out the numerical answer in the defreal result\n\nSet price of present stock and dividend to 100"

Since the amortization is only calculated based on a unit sold, the number of units exceeding the amortization expense leads to setting the amortization expense equal to zero or lower. And initially the amortization value is the cost of a patent ownership.\n\nComment: The question is: \"Do we have to enter a new prototype every time we build a quantity of the product?

Therefore, the value for the first step is \\textbf{10000/100=100}. When he sell it, the shareholder gets \\textbf{+200} which is the profit. The first hypothesis would look like: The distribution of the profits is \\textbf{h/p = x/100 = x}.\n\nIf you believe that it asks to find the \\textbf{share of the profit from selling stock} that the shareholder shares with individual share,\nthat would be \\textbf{100/10000 = 10\\%}. In other words, he shares \\textbf{10\\% of the profit} with individuals at the time of the picking ratio. The first hypothesis would look like: The money division is \\textbf{50/100 = x%}. Please observe that our answer is again 10\\% which is the same. We can make it work by making use of the assumption that 100 shares of stock are purchased and sold.\n\nIf you believe that it asks to find the \\textbf{amount of money that the shareholder spends just to equity}, that would look like \\textbf{p=100×100} to give the beauty a fuzzy touch.\n\nIn the end, in the final answer, for example, you could say: We found that the shareholder"

The highest number of shares we can buy or sell at the auction is 150 + 500 = 650 shares.\n\n1b. Now consider the other side of the ticker. The bidding strategies are different. Lowest numbers sell at what level $18.00? There are 6 bids with no ask in this section. At the next level (ask price of 18.50) there are 2 bids without answers or limits. And will end with 2 bidders that have set asking prices for 19.75 and 20.50 per share. Therefore, we think that the lowest offer price could be $19.20 since that is the minimum amount necessary to overcome the 6 bids without 'offer' input.\n\n2. We can simply substract:\n\n2a. 350 - 19.20 = $14.80 X 700 = $11,020\n\n2b. 650 - 19.75 = $12,770\n\n2c.

Third, the nominal GDP deflator surged from 120 to 170, however, we need to correct this number to the price levels in the previous year. We use the GDP deflator in the previous year to do so. This means the deflator surged from 250 to 340, and therefore the nominal GDP deflator surged from 120 to 200. This means that the real GDP is lower than the nominal GDP. In case of the reverse, real GDP exceeds the nominal GDP. In that case, the nominal GDP deflator is negative.

Therefore, the maturity notional equals one.\nAt time $t = +4 $ weeks, the current spot price equals $56$ while the initial forward price was set at $60$. This implies that the floating price of the contract equals $4$; this is because $56$ is equal to $60 – 4$, and accordingly, FeFr is equal to $0$. Thus, the executive endowed $1$ to the broker by selling the position at $60$ at time $t = 0$, and received $4$ if selling it at time $t = 4$ weeks later at the price of the spot. Note that by assumption, the forward price is set at $60$ at time $t = 0$ and it is traded at time $t = 4$ weeks at the spot price, such that no profits or losses are done. Therefore, the maturity value is $1$.\n\nThen, you need to calculate the executive’s initial forward profit.\nBy assumption, the executive earns profit of $1$ one month prior to the expiry of the contract.\nThus, the initial forward premium is $p_0 = +1$.\nTherefore, the fee Wi can be described by\n\\begin{align*}\nf_0 = (Wi_0) = (0 + \\frac{0.3}{12}) ≈ 0.1096\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe change in the forward price between $t = 0$ and $t = 4$ weeks thus equals $\\beta + \\beta f_0$, which equals $0.01$.\n\nThe value of the executive’s position can thus be described by\n\\begin{align*}\nV_4 = V_0 + \\beta×60 + \\beta f_0×4 + \\frac{Wi_0}{12}×4 + \\frac{(Wi_0)*\\beta}{12}×4 + \\frac{(Xi_0)*\\beta}{12}×4 =$...\n\\end{align*}\nConsider the initial proposition is correct."

So let's calculate directly the annual return and the standard deviation, as expected return, the fund manager also have skills to identify good stocks.\n\nAmong the different components of the fund separately calculate the return. How much of the fund manager's contribution is due to skill and how much is due to chance?\nWe can calculate the so-called active and active risk separately of each component of the portfolo.\nInformation ratio is VWAr/(unit-stdev2*Vω), where Vω is standard deviation of the portfolio and VWAr is the volatility of the average (deviation of the cumulative return), that is, the cumulative volatility, and the VWAr and Vω equal to the return of the individual portfolio units.\n\"F34F5A2\" is the ciphervarj of the answer.\n\nHint: You can use the concepts of Active Return, Active Risk and Information Ratio.\nTips: Use English vocabulary to write the answer.

            "\n\nStep 1: Let's recall how to determine the future value of option.\nThe selling price of the option contract is $4 and it would cost $4250 each to exercise the option to purchase a contract representing 1 unit of the underlying asset.\nTherefore, before the expiry date, the option is expected to be in the money.\n\nStep 2: Let's think about the answer and transition to another ''what if'' idea. For a dealer, the up-front debit of $4 for every contract represents a return if and only if the asset price is greater than the strike price, $50. Consider that the asset price at expiry is $55.\n\nStep 3: Let's illustrate a table to represent this example. Revisit option pricing table in class and check the values.\n\nSo, at this moment, we know that the selling price of the choise is $4. The call options begin to be in-the-money as soon as the price of the underlying asset is equal or higher to $50. If the underlying asset price is higher than $50, the value of option is higher than $4. Therefore, the buyer of the choise must pay an up front price and then at expiry, when the transaction replaces together, the price difference between two prices(old - new) is the difference between a buyer(seller) gain and a seller(buyer) loss.\nIf the underlying asset is lower than $50, option format when waiting been put now so the price of the option is losing value as time goes by. Even if the value of the option is $9, it is still no longer worth to commit to a transaction. Therefore, no one would continue to buy the choise any longer."

The stock price reached $42 at the end of year 20X5. The outstanding total number of common shares is 1,800,000. Total yield: $1,036,000 (calculated as $42*(1,800,000/55000)). Compare the given answer with your solution, is the answer reasonable?\n\nAnswer: There are 3 steps you need to consider in this case:\n\n1.How many employees get the options? So let's say 20,000 employees, eligible employees\n\n2.What is the exercise price of these options? So we takes the easy 1/2 first, assume 12,000 employees exercise the options. 12/24=50, so that's one-half of 24,000.\n\n3.What is the stock price on January 1st? Divide the actual data by the total outstanding number of stocks. For this case it's $42/$1,800,000=0.002348,so 23.48%.\n\nSo the denominator is 0.002348x0.5x12000=-515.12.\n\n=======================================\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer, but this is not enough.

This collateral is made up of bonds from a company with an A-level rating. The business partner holds a B+ rating.

Therefore, we assign them with the risk weight 50%; £180M\nTotal book value : £200M (80M * 2 + 120M * 1.5 + 180M * 0.5)\nAssuming we just assume 10% of 200M is of market value, the fair value would be a little less than 0.8*.\nThe real situation is the collar may buy it back, or contingent loan requirement may be activated; therefore the value may still be zero. Now, we are just looking the book value.\nThe risk weighted assets (RWA) is the risk of exposure to the debts too.\nNow, go back to the calculation base on the risk weight formula.\n80M * 2 + 120M * 2 * 0.5 + 180M * 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.5 * 0.5 = $550.2M ($1B * 0.0001)\nThe RWA concept can calculate the capital base in the banking world.

Hope this would give you good insight.\n\nAnswer: The process is simplified as follows.\n\nThe values of the collateral are as follows: bonds (paid through volatility), and loans. Both are rated (A) and (B+). Both collateral paired values are high and low value ($ 120 and $ 200). The other side referred to as 'The Other' which is not rated.\n\nOur exposure is the 'Other'. To get an answer, we have to sum up the \"value of collateral\" and \"exposure.\" The expressing method for both lines is just '*', and they are 0.5 and 0.6, plus 0.8 multiplied by the collateral value, the answer is $ 408M, which is $ 80M multiplied by 50% multiplied by 1.25.\n"

So first let’s verify this by recasting the question as\n\n\\begin{code}\nQuestion: What would be the standard deviation of the portfolio? - 2.9\n\\end{code}\n\nIf this inequality does not hold, then one of the guesses is a negative value. And as we are required to start our answer with an answer, it proves that we made a wrong forecast.\n\nSo it was a mistake on some other part, so let’s consider another answer, lets assume that either of the variances is wrong. As they are logically independent, their uncertainty would addition up in standard deviations. They will interpret it as a measure of standard error of the mean, implying that they are we use the square root of the sum of the variance.\n\nSo let’s verify it with a few calculations. As the amount of variance for the properties X and Y can be defined as the four differential and difference coefficient, then either (SD of X - SD of Y) or (SD of Y - SD of X) can be the correct result if only one of these is positive. But our answer was negative, so as long as this difference is positive, whatever can be the sign.\n\nTherefore, the answer is more likely to be given as the SD of X - SD of Y, but we are required to write the sign in the answer.

Pension equals to 60% of the last salary and grows perfectly with inflation rate. Employees always live for 25 years post-retirement. The money within the retirement plan is invested in bonds that yield an inflation rate. Which is the best approximation of the portion of the worker's income that ought to be put into the retirement plan? (Hint: You should perform all calculations in real and not nominal terms so that the income and pensions stay constant and the interest yield is zero.)",

            " First, let's write the question.\n\nThe answer is ...\nTherefore, the answer is ...\nThe income of an employee gradually translates to the income of a peer. Therefore, the value X can be translated in the currency that will give the same result after covering inflation for the 25 years post-retirement. Let an average wage with inflation rate maximum $1,500. Let the age be mature and equal to 45. Let the age after retirement be j25. The target is to earn X% of the salary in the pe kitchen. Therefore, we should earn X% of $1,500(t=45) = $225(t=j25). In our case, Notice that the income during post-retirement will be 60% of $1,438 = $846, and so the amount that should be started is X% of $846 = $72. Since the rate of inflation will apply the amount to $1,460, we shall earn 0% after the payment of taxes, that is, pay $72 each month. Coun see that earning $62,490, full price will be done in 120 months (the number of months from $1,500 to $1,460).  So that is how it solves the problem. Thanks for helping.\n\nComment: You need to edit before the site will fix it.\n\nAnswer: I see several questions.  I will try to answer some of them.\n\n(1) Can I get a souped-up calculator?  Why not?  Computer science students can do something like this.  I think that you might want to ask a CS professor if you can do something like this (and maybe show any code you might write).\n\nNote that the best answer often comes with the most simplifications and approximations. So, instead of trying to see what the best percentage is, it might be significant enough to know that a mere 25% of the income is better than zero.\n\n(2) How can I work with nominal payments to compute ratios?  I suspect that you could use substitutions for nominal values.  For example, a worker paid at Year 45 could be $1,"

So, maybe it's not totally clear, but the equation is actually this joke picture instead of unnecessary grouping.\" What we want to do is simplify. So, what is the first thing that we need to do or find out is the face value of the bond, so that we can then transform that. So, if we multiply face value times one minus the number of times two up to the face value. Then what about the difference between the face value of the bond and the exercise price. It's simply equals the present value of the bond.\nSo, as you can see, \"Now we remember that we are working on the binomial pricing model.\" Well, the binomial pricing model with n time intervals means that we have? If we are going to have a present value of something that we are dealing with an interest rate. There are actually n of this term here. And if we are talking about a validated interest rate then the appropriate term in parentheses is n of V of r each time we have a term of this. First of all, we will simplify the present value of the bond so that we do not worry about the not the exercise price. So, it's all about the face value of the bond, and the interest rate. And we know that we can simply say what the her first existing market is what is the appropriate standard because there is a time interval of n time intervals? Isn't it directly right to its number one-half? So, just because it's a zero coupon bond doesn't mean that anything else is going on. So, if we know hat we are talking about a zero coupon bond we need to set the appropriate BII her mark to 0.5 as well. So, what we do now is to multiply both terms by the outcome of her first market by our factor of 0.5 regularly.\n\nComment: This is not well formatted.\n\nComment: Please remember that you are expected to format your posts using markdown.

The steps to get the formula in above are showed in Eq (5-4) to Fig (5-2) in the book. Coming to reply the question, we need to come up with the fiscal effect. We can get the fiscal effect by solving the fiscal-inflation relation in Eq (5-4). The fiscal effect will describe the policy reaction to However, in this statement the author guess the fitst half of the taylor rule could also play a role on the interest rate. But the first half rule never told the how much effect it has on the interest rate and therefore the author ignore the simtaneous process that involve fiscal policy. So we use only the economic sway – equation 5-6. The fiscal effect in this method is calculated as follows\n\n\\begin{equation}\ndY_t = -\\gamma_\\text{i}(ρ_i-1)Y_t - \\beta_π(ρ_i-1)％. ∂P_i ∂ πi- (\\beta_p-1)％. ∂P_p ∂ πp.\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen using the table, we calculate the economic sway.

Therefore, we will assume that the price of QQQ is expected to converge to its fair value in a month.\n\\item Next, we need to find $b$ because we would like to create a model to estimate the future profit of this contract. We assume that the price of QQQ will converge to its fair value.

In my second year I got this qus.. I wrote my answer...  In comparison to EPS, the FCFF results for 2018 show greater value for the budget revenue and the budget net income. The budget EPS does not yield the same result as the EPS shown in the statements, as indicated by the higher regression line for the budget EPS. Even so, the budget EPS and FCFF results show that PZ, Inc. will likely achieve a higher net income than expected in 2018. As such, Jacques will want to take advantage of this information when making investment decisions and managing the business.: 36.13\n\nComment: Since 2019 financial performance is projected to be more favorable than estimated, I believe that PZ, Inc. will\nwin an improvement in liquidity and also cause the ratios of financial-performance measures to improve,\n since EBITDA over year is estimated to contain a lower impression. Slowing interest payments to the drop rate in fcff will result in a lower depreciation expense as the debt is taken care off. A more favorable tax information and net income will result in factors for a lower income tax rate, and higher free cash flow. Hence I think Jacques will be able to take advantage more from the financial process. : 36.14.Paul\n\nComment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=issueQvOry8M\n\nAnswer: You shouldn't have a hard time setting up the forecast as it's a stock analysis case study and your assumptions are direction and magnitude of growth.

Therefore, we examine how can we know that they are above average.\n\n3rd step: Through the share price. For this, we are given 65.5, meaning that we can read that current market value is 65.5. and we know profitability through share price.\n\n4th step: Check P/E versus EXIBIT 1, sales (I get that the most appropriate scale is in EPS, so I don't have to do the phenomenal investigating step that Accounting in practice does to determine a rule of thumb or P/E). So engaging in this, we check that P/S is lower than the average, e.g. 5 to low 9, and therefore relative.\n\nA quick-witted person would immediately landscape to Exhibit 1 and realize the low P/E ratio is around ~5 to 9, therefore much lower than average. THEN, they would check Avg P/E ratio, which is 15 according to Exhibit 1, because they know that P/S is not very high.\n\n5th step: So if P/S is ~17x, we can bet that company might sell for greater than $65.5 if you know that you think PE = Sales/Earnings. So the PE should be 5.5-6.5.\n\n6th: Therefore, you would compare 5.5-6.5/4= $12.7 to $16.625\nAND, if you want to analyze what is the most appropriate ratio and the basis of this conclusion, you could resultingly estimate if you get HOWS = 10 -% to 5 % you done. Additionally, the financial ratio P/E makes the conclusion that this ratio can capitalize the P/S afterward deduct the profit.\n\nAfter this, struggling to weight what defines the share's jaws' worth: P/E"

Also, `{` is the text expression inside `{` and `}` pairs. I suggest simply wrap it in a string: `if p X ms + \"PPH\"`. It's bad programming practice to use unlimited pointer arithmetics and an arithmetic bigмирования, but it's bad practice to use unlimited string parsing. In JExl you need the latter, so your program does not work even with implicit strings. As you can not do a do option without doing some arithmetic (due to the linear substrate, it can not be tricks), the simplest way is to not try to put in new punctuation.\n\nComment: I edited my answer according to comment.

Two jacks are tossed not a loss of half a jack.\nTherefore, the probability to toss two jack in on independent tosses is (1/18)x(1/18)=(1/18)x(1/18)=(1/18)x(1/18)=1/696.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Con't! \\strong{The probability of two heads on independent tosses=Pof2 Head on Independences Tosses=1/3}\n\\item (1)x(1/3)=1/9 in one toss, if T and H are independent\n\\item Haltrol(2)x(1/3)=1/27.

Read [ask] and [help] to learn more about how to write a thorough question.\n\nAnswer: To answer your question:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nGiven the information provided, what is LoveYourHome's trailing Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe trailing P/E ratio is the ratio between:\n\n\\begin{code}\nP/E = share price / EPS\n\\end{code}\n\nSo you need to $1 - `52 / 56 = .76`\n\nThen answer your own question.\n\nIn your code:\n\n\\begin{code}\n.fullName < name$ >\n.preRatio <  P/E >\n\\end{code}\n\nThe second one seems odd since you already subsetted on the first variable. Add a second `>` to the second one.\n\n\\begin{code}\n.preRatio <  P/E >   # shouldn't this be > ?\n\\end{code}\n\nSimilarly for your last line. Shouldn't it be\n\n\\begin{code}\n.fullName < name$ >\n.previous <  DOFs$ >\n\\end{code}\n\nSecond solution:\n\nYour code is overall strange. You basically extract your data and then programmatically feed it into your data frame. Where is this not possible. Do like:\n\n\\begin{code}\n## Load packages for extra features\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n## get the response\nmy_df <- read.table(\"/File/location/of/the/my_df.csv\")\n\\end{code}\n\nIn a function definition you can do:\n\n\\begin{code}\nextract_data_frame <- function(my_df){"

Coupon rate is 7% and the interest rate (good interest rate for second year) is 5% (see 3rd step => 7%/5%).\nSo the answer is 14% for 2-year bond. This is my answer."

Does it need to be reported for each year? I will answer this step and later re-edit and add this part if it is really necessary because I think the answer can quite be written without this part.\n\nSo the practitioner would choose a time length. He/she will report the data of ROE for every stock in that time length. (by defining ti= the ti-th data point: p= t1, p+1=t1+1, p+2=t1+2 etc) then calculate the mean ROE based on the following equation: ρ = mean of ROE for every stock i in the time length.  The profitability ratios of the two companies are each ROE = value of the stock/1000000 [ When i=0, the variable D/Ei=0 (since both companies have zero debt) and the variable Sizei=0 (since both companies have 1000000 shares each)]. So the ROE of each company is equal to 0.1.\n\nStep 2: When surprising, we might have to re-check the linear model, that is, we may write down another model manually to get explanation.

There are two things to consider here: one is the income elasticity of demand and the other is income measurement. Measurement of real income or disposable income is extremely important in using an elasticity measure to derive an application.Therefore, measuring disposable income is important.\nAs mentioned above, real income or disposables income is how much is left over or available after paying for living expenses and after taxes. The rule of thumb is $2,300 per person or $6,300 for a household of a familyFor example, 3,000 RMB ≈ $ 470.03\n\nIt's assumed that the 10,000 RMB ≈ $1,452.90\nand\nNow that we know how to measure disposable income, there are three things to consider when examining income elasticity: supply or inputs, price, and income. It is known that marginal utility is an increasing consumption function and that price elasticity is therefore greater than zero. If an elasticity product is less than one, there is a substituent elasticity of demand - the term that represents how what people chose to buy in place of what they purchased previously, assuming price remains currently constant, appears when giving credit for the total sales of a wage plan. If the elasticity of demand is less than one, then the economic changes in quantity demanded are smaller than economic changes in price.\n\n2. Substituting in for real income or disposables income, the given value for 2Pmobile would be calculated as:\n\n2Pmobile=3000-(10000-2x3000)-0.05x10000\n2Pmobile=900\n\n3.

For simplicity sake, I solve the question using the following form of the Loewe's model:\nCommitment capital invested <= intensity <=< Distributable cash generated.\nPrior to any distributions, invested capital yields interest income until the capital is paid out. Note that in the accounting call according to arbitrary standards of accounting, committed capital is almost equal to paid-in capital. But, in reality, let's say that what the partnership agrees on to pay out anytime during certain reference dates. Payouts can be made when the capital is fully invested or in regular intervals based on either case. Note that there may be restrictions on when the cash may be paid. So, while accounting standard may state that committed capital is equal to Invested capital, a third property may be ready to account for paid in and paid out capital.\n\nBased on the the the given data and subtracting the payouts and residuals of distributive rule (considered an intensity) from the committed capital and the distributable cash generated.

Equipment is sold, and this indicates 'Revenue'. And 'Reported equipment loss of $2 million' indicates 'Costs' and 'Loss of equipment sales'. All of the above factors need to be combined into a sentence to measure the gain from asset sales, which should be '$2 - $7 = -$5 million'. Then we will get the cost of equipment sale as '$7 million'. We should combine these two cost with the annual capital outlays $10 million because we should look at this information in a year-over-year manner. Annual capital outlays minus annual costs= savings.

Remember that 30% of it is equity like because it separated out and got the 9% then recombined again with 0.3% as Robert's leverage or debt factor and that got combined again with the other 70% that is a debt like factor. Then you total all these out to 42,734. 45% of 42,734 is 19,605, In order to have 45% Equity, you need roughly the same amount of debt.

In case of bond C, it is not defaulted, therefore it has built in an external pool of cash to pay interest in a case Class C bond is defaulted. In same case, bond C will not pay interests from first 5 months if Class A bond will declerf(won't get principle back).\ntherefore, I am assuming that both B and C will be defaulted before Class A bond.

Just by looking at the price change I can get the years to maturity by dividing it to the price, then we directly calculate the modified duration.\nDuration is called importance measure of a bond because it indicates the period of time that market price moves by $1 for 100 of a bond. A bond will become more duration if its price changes by $1 and given a shorter time [for instant, if a bond price changes $0.50 and a period of time is 50 years then a bond will have a lower Duration than a bond price change $0.50 and a period of time is 10.

            "\n\nQ1: The focal question does not ask about total price of daily sales. But the question asks the quantity of daily sales that is in μ±3σ range. So, we need to know first what is the number of daily sales that is in this range? i.e. $230,000-480,000$.\nLet's use chi square test to make sure our assumption about the normality is right. Under the normality distribution, the random sample size is less than, or equal to 4. So, using chi-square test, we have a p-value = 0.99. The p-value is high and the chi square test does not give any hint at all that the normality assumption is not true. Therefore, we can say that our assumption of normality distribution for the corporation sales is correct and we can use the standard normal table and the Gaussian table to get the quantile area.\n\nQ2: Ignoring the summation terms, we know that 0.99 x 3σ = 3.98σ-6.94σi.e. from -6.94₵ to 9.94±1.9 times the IQR\nfrom 0 to 1.9 times the IQR\noverall, we need to look at the bottom half of the distribution.\nNow using the Gaussian table, we know that area under the NORM.S.INV(-5.827)to 1.9 times IQR. is 0.06516. So, cumulatively, half of the area is -0.06516x4 = -0.027\n−½ x aprox value = -3.96₵\nThen the maximum cumulative area for 99% of values falls within this two z scores (-5.827 to -3.96)\nQ3: We should work out 1 – 0.9 – 0.99 as an example.\nThis means, (1-0.9)≅0.0109 – (0.9-0.99)≅-0.00011. So we get (1-0.9)/0.0001 = 99"

The answer: 919,399.8.\n\nThis is the part that I am not clear: why should we discount everything and then sum them at the end????\n\nor\n\nWhy not simply \"apply the effective interest rate method\" for the cashflows and then add 917,157 ?\n\nAnswer: I think you should discount the cashflows now and then wait for the next ones to arrive. If you discount in the future (in the second case you just calculated) you will have to forecast future cash flow based on your discount rate (and what ever other assumptions you have). To discount in the future is something only you know. Why don't you just use your problem like this: the present value $1,197,356.8 and then get the final amount. For the final amount you need the cashflows until the end of the ten years.\n\nComment: So you need to do the mathematics before you know what is happening with payments of the bond?

            " At first, we need to calculate the notional principle of the swap, and then we need to calculate the first net interest payment. Lets start with the notional principle of the swap.\nThe swap's fixed rate is 5% and the floating rate is Libor, with payments made every six months.\nThe notional principle of the swap is also $5 million.\nLibor is an abbreviation of London Interbank Offered Rate. According to certain financial standards, \" Libor rate is the interest rate established through an auction of loans by UK banks taking libor rate as a benchmark.\" In the auction, banks quoting their interest rates, and then accept which rates are estimated to be better. The net loan rates at auction are mainly formed under experience, market mechanism and the characteristics of products, borrowers and the market.\n\nSince Libor is experience-based, that means if the international business environment changes, the Libor rate may also change.\nIf there are too much international business, loans will be larger. So more Libor rates will be formed.\nIf there are too many loans, Libor rates may be in shortage. So more will be formed Libor rates.\n\nIn the fixing rate scheme of Libor, it is subject to laws and regulations in UK on banking and making loans. But since Libor is based on experience and market mechanism and has part of the characteristics of banks, loans, business environment and products, the Libor rate has some determined factors.\n\nComment: this is not really an answer to the question. wouldn't you be better off only writing a part of the answer and defining your intent, and then maybe adding some statements that you have already researched or completed in the question box at the bottom of all the crc questions? you did do that for your answer, which is better than nothing, but allowing the questions to answer themselves gets automated away which is not high quality within the site. is there a way to summarise the question in the answer? would that be possible within the form that you are posting your response?\n\nAnswer: solution:\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nyour solution:\n\n\\begin{code}\nYour solution:\n\nP=5,000,000\nP+P=-2,500,000+P=900,000\n\n"

So  $250 in cash.\nDistributions to owners should be minus and have an increase in equity\nof $250 so cash increases to 1250.\nDistributions to Owners should total to 250 since\nthe 800 retained earning also was included.\nTotal of  liabilitiesand Equity should be $1500 as against\nNet Income of  $1750.\nAs for Equity the Definetion mainly follows:\nFinancial technology Powered … The  distinction  between  the phrase Equity and Liabilities is that , Liabilities are defined in the manner that Balance Equals Negative of Total  Assets (+Obligations) Plus Retentions. Here Obligations refer to Accouting debts or external management auditors referred obligation to take care of liability. Equity in a Balance Equals Total Assets Minus Total Liabilities where Total Assets are defined in inclusion of Statutory AO and allocation of Free Reserves.\nAccording to the balance sheet the balance  should be zero because this was obtained by subtraction which would lead the answer to incorrect.  Distributions to  or Owners should cover the retained earning once by the title  and the  statement should  also state that retained earning before distributions. The company requires a net  operations ultimately this should not get printed out as a negative\n\n$1200-250-200 -200+800 = 0 is required. So Liabilities are 0\n\\end{code}\n\nBest Solution sent by the Finance Expert:\n\n"

            "\n\n1.How to get\n\n\"Fund manager constructs a portfolio with standard deviation of a certain value to construct a portfolio\"?\n\nOnce we get the \"portfolios's standard deviation\" value, we know how much asset \"1\" portfolio and \"2\" portfolio should hold. So then device up the weight that they will hold in \"Security1\" and \"Security2\" portfolios to decrease the damages of volatility. Then compare their volatility to the expected volatility as shown below:\n\n2 1 +10.339002681955251E-15 X=0.9036522520329207Y % 1.535621159060439E-14************************ X=100Y% 0.1688E-06----------Weight(%)\n\nComparing the two standard deviations, we observe that the portfolio's standard deviation is $0.2569$, compared to our goal portfolio standard deviation of $14.40$\\%, which is greater than expected variance. Therefore, we need to decrease the asset that undertakes more the standard deviation.\n\n3.How to get \"asset undertake more\" standard deviation and damages of volatility of the fund management?\n\nWe observe that the standard deviation and volatility of asset1 is $9.91\\%$, while volatility of  asset2 is $5.95\\%$.\n\nThe portfolio with most damages of volatility is asset-1. Therefore, the asset-1 should be overweighted.\n\n4.How to get \"portfolio with most damages of volatility\"?\n\nTherefore, the answer is asset-1 provides fund manager the damage of volatility $15.47\\%$.\n\nAnswer: We can do it in python using pandas and scipy:\n\n\\begin{code}\n#set up dataframe\ndf = pandas.DataFrame([['Security-1','Security weight(%)'],\n                      ['Security-2','Expected Standard Deviation (%)']]).T\n\n#determine asset 1 VS 2, variance and standard deviation\nindex = 0\nasset"

Lost is a one-time expense for the year of purchase. There is no effect on the cash flow since the cash has already been spend.\nIn other words, the net income = 30,000-180000=150,000\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: thats wrong, after depreciation you get $30,000, then you subtract the amount of tax required to be paid, 180,000. As a result, your net income = $520,000.\n\nComment: That `180,000` is a loss. That is why I have the `-`\n\nAnswer: There is nothing wrong with cash accounting. But the article didn't explain the logic behind the calculation of cash taxes on using several methodologies for the calculation of charges as the article suggests straightline depreciation report situations in which the difference in fair value of the asset on the date of acquisition and it's sale subsequent to canslack acquisition are not relevant."
