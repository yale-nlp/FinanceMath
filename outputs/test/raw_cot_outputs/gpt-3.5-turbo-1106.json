The offer from Peterson values Heartland at an enterprise worth of USD40.6 billion, which includes USD4.3 billion of existing Heartland debt. In order to finance the consideration of USD55 in cash along with 2.25 Peterson shares for each Heartland share, Peterson intends to issue 104 million new shares and will raise approximately USD26 billion in new debt, with the remaining being funded by cash on hand. Once the deal has closed, Peterson anticipates having an outstanding debt of nearly USD62 billion. Before the acquisition, Peterson had 1.096 billion shares in circulation, each trading at USD125. With the assumption of a constant share price and the book value of debt being equal to its market value, Jackson plans to ascertain the change in the proportions of debt and equity in Peterson’s capital structure following",

            "First, let's calculate the total value of the acquisition consideration. The cash consideration is USD55 per share for each Heartland share, and since Heartland has a total of 104 million shares, the cash consideration would be 55 * 104 million, which equals USD5.72 billion. The share consideration is 2.25 Peterson shares for each Heartland share, and since there are 1.096 billion Peterson shares outstanding, the share consideration would be 2.25 * 1.096 billion, resulting in 2.46 billion shares. Multiplying 2.46 billion shares by the current trading price of USD125 per share, we get USD307.5 billion. Therefore, the total value of the acquisition consideration would be USD5.72 billion (cash) + USD307.5 billion (shares), giving a total of USD313.22 billion.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of new shares issued by Peterson for the acquisition. Peterson will issue 104 million new shares, adding to the existing 1.096 billion shares, resulting in a total of 1.2 billion shares after the acquisition.\n\nFinally, we can determine the change in the proportion of debt and equity in Peterson's capital structure. Before the acquisition, Peterson's market value of equity can be calculated as the number of shares (1.096 billion) multiplied by the share price (USD125), giving USD137 billion. The book value of debt before the acquisition is USD62 billion. After the acquisition, the market value of equity would be the new number of shares (1.2 billion) multiplied by the constant share price (USD125), resulting in USD150 billion. The increase in the value of equity is USD13 billion. Hence, the final proportion of debt and equity in Peterson's capital structure following the acquisition can be calculated by considering the total outstanding debt of nearly USD62 billion and the increased value of equity of USD13 billion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is USD13 billion."

The diluted weighted average common shares would be 54,000,000 (50,000,000 + 4,000,000). Therefore, the diluted EPS would be $200,000,000 / 54,000,000 = $3.70.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $3.70."

The initial yield can be calculated using the formula: Initial yield = Coupon payment / Current price of the bond. Using the given information, the initial yield is 5% (coupon) / 100 (current price) = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the anticipated total return over a one-year term if the bond is demoted by two notches. Since the bond is currently rated A+ and would be demoted to A-, we can refer to Table 2 to find the corresponding G-Spreads. The G-Spread for A+ is 0.85 and for A- is 1.10. Therefore, the increase in G-Spread due to the demotion is 1.10 - 0.85 = 0.25.\n\nThe anticipated total return can be calculated using the formula: Anticipated total return = Initial yield + Change in G-Spread. Plugging in the initial yield of 5% and the change in G-Spread of 0.25, we get 5% + 0.25 = 5.25%.\n\nLastly, we need to calculate the projected yield on Jones' demo bond over a one-year span. Using the concept of duration, where the year-end duration for the bond is given as 6.9, we can calculate the projected yield using the formula: Projected yield = Initial yield - (Change in G-Spread * Duration). Plugging in the initial yield of 5%, the change in G-Spread of 0.25, and the duration of 6.9, we get 5% - (0.25 * 6.9) = 3.825%.\n\nTherefore, the projected yield on Jones' demo bond over a one-year span is 3.825%."

In this case, the earnings would be 10 million shares * US$2.00, which equals US$20 million.\n\nNext, let's calculate the new book value per share after the stock buyback. The book value per share is the total value of the company's equity divided by the number of outstanding shares. After the stock buyback, the total equity would be reduced by the value of the bought-back shares. If the corporation spends the same amount to repurchase the stocks as the book value per share, then the new book value per share would be the previous book value per share minus the amount spent on the buyback.

Therefore, the annual depreciation expense is $60,000 / 6 = $10,000. Next, we calculate the taxable income for the 6th year by subtracting the depreciation expense from the annual cash inflow: $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000. Then, we apply the tax rate of 40% to the taxable income, resulting in a tax payable of $6,000 in the 6th year. Therefore, the answer is $6,000."

FCFF = Net Income + Depreciation - Change in Working Capital - Capital Expenditure\n   Net Income = $626 million\n   Depreciation = $243 million\n   Change in Working Capital = (2012 Current Assets - 2011 Current Assets) - (2012 Current Liabilities - 2011 Current Liabilities)\n                           = ($1,290 million - $1,199 million) - ($2,783 million - $2,678 million)\n                           = $91 million - $105 million\n                           = -$14 million\n   Capital Expenditure = 2012 Fixed Capital Investment = $535 million\n   Therefore, FCFF = $626 + $243 - (-$14) - $535\n                  = $626 + $243 + $14 - $535\n                  = $348 million\n\n2.

Plugging these values into the formula, we can solve for the interest rate. \n\nUsing the present value formula for annuity due, we can then find the present value of the annuity due using the interest rate we calculated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $16,215.70."

For the 600 units purchased in April at $3 each, the total cost is 600 * $3 = $1800. Therefore, the total cost of goods purchased is $1000 + $1800 = $2800.\n\nNext, when employing the FIFO method, the cost of goods sold is calculated based on the earliest purchased units. Since John sold 1000 units, we need to calculate the cost of the first 1000 units purchased. The first 500 units were purchased at $2 each, so the cost of these units is 500 * $2 = $1000. The next 500 units were purchased at $3 each, but we only need the cost of 500 - 1000 = 500 units, which is 500 * $3 = $1500.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of goods sold in 2017 using the FIFO method is $1000 (from the first 500 units) + $1500 (from the next 500 units) = $2500.

Here, V = $50,000 and Δσ = 20% - 19% = 1%.\n\nNext, we can calculate the present value of the remaining vega notional using the formula: Present value = V * Δσ * √T * exp(-rT), where T is the remaining time to maturity, and r is the annual interest rate.

The dividend received is 100 shares * $2.50 per share = $250.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of purchasing 100 shares of Monticello at $45 to settle the short position, which is 100 shares * $45 per share = $4500.\n\nLastly, let's consider the commission for settling the short position, which is $145.\n\nTo calculate the rate of return, we add the dividend received and subtract the costs of shorting and settling the position, and then divide by the initial investment.\n\nThe rate of return is (($250 dividend - $155 acquisition commission - $4500 purchase cost - $145 settlement commission) / $5600 initial investment) * 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately -14.46%."

The administrative fee is 2% of $650 million, which equals $13 million.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the incentive fee. The fund's performance exceeded the initial requirement rate, so the incentive fee applies to the excess earnings. The excess earnings are $650 million - $580 million - ($580 million * 4%) = $650 million - $580 million - $23.2 million = $46.8 million. The incentive fee is 20% of $46.8 million, which equals $9.36 million.\n\nTherefore, the total fees for the year are $13 million (administrative fee) + $9.36 million (incentive fee) = $22.36 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net percentage return to a shareholder. The net earnings after fees are $650 million - $22.36 million = $627.64 million.

Since the U.S. uses the \"step-up\" in basis at death system, Jennifer's cost basis for the shares is adjusted to the market value at the time of the relative's death, which was $220,000. So the capital gain is $190,000 - $220,000 = -$30,000. However, due to the \"step-up\" in basis, Jennifer's capital gain is actually -$30,000, meaning she has a capital loss rather than a gain.
