The offer from Peterson values Heartland at an enterprise worth of USD40.6 billion, which includes USD4.3 billion of existing Heartland debt. In order to finance the consideration of USD55 in cash along with 2.25 Peterson shares for each Heartland share, Peterson intends to issue 104 million new shares and will raise approximately USD26 billion in new debt, with the remaining being funded by cash on hand. Once the deal has closed, Peterson anticipates having an outstanding debt of nearly USD62 billion. Before the acquisition, Peterson had 1.096 billion shares in circulation, each trading at USD125. With the assumption of a constant share price and the book value of debt being equal to its market value, Jackson plans to ascertain the change in the proportions of debt and equity in Peterson’s capital structure following",

Thus weighing the 2 quantities so that the total outcome from 45,000 and 50,000 is 47,500. Once the price per unit for these two inventory costs has been calculated, this new price can be applied to the 45,000 units in year 2.\nSince there is a difference between the cost of year 2's inventory and the cost derived from beginning the year with the 45,000 units, the remainder will be taken from the additional 50,000 units purchased during year 2. In short, to find the inventory sold, the cost per unit must be multiplied by 45,000. The remainder of the total of the 50,000 units means that the remaining units inventory costs are taken from the further 25,000 units purchased during year 2.\nSummary of those 2 steps:\n45,000 + 50,000 = 95,000 (inventory cost)\n45,000 * €11 = €495,000 (cost of sales)\n50,000 * €11 = €550,000 (inventory cost)\nAs mentioned above, since each unit sold during the year was taken from the 45,000 in beginning inventory and the remaining 25,000 from the 50,000 additional purchased in 2008, the formula is €495,000 / 45,000 = €6/unit.\nTherefore, this price is invoiced to each customer who buys the product.

            "\nTo answer this question, we need to first understand how a utility function works. A utility function is a mathematical representation of an individual's preferences over alternative choices. In the context of investments, the utility function measures the level of satisfaction or happiness an investor derives from a particular investment.\n\nSince Mauricio Garcia is a daring investor, we can assume that he is not risk-averse, which means he is not concerned about the risks involved in a particular investment. In other words, his utility function will have a lower risk aversion parameter (in this case, -3), which means he is willing to accept more risk in exchange for higher potential returns.\n\nLet's now consider each of the potential investments:\n\nInvestment 1: Expected Return = 19%, Expected Standard Deviation = 3%\nInvestment 2: Expected Return = 21%, Expected Standard Deviation = 9%\nInvestment 3: Expected Return = 24%, Expected Standard Deviation = 20%\nInvestment 4: Expected Return = 19%, Expected Standard Deviation = 35%\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Investment 3 offers the highest expected return (24%), but it also has the highest expected standard deviation (20%). As a daring investor, Mauricio Garcia is most likely to choose Investment 3, as he is willing to accept the risk associated with the potential higher return.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Investment 3."

Applying Bayes' theorem, what is the likelihood that an enterprise leader will be dismissed given \"good\" performance? (Hint, let P(A) be the likelihood of an enterprise leader being dismissed, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" performance rating, P(B I A) represent the possibility of a \"good\" performance rating given that the enterprise leader was dismissed, and P(A I B) signify the probability of the enterprise leader being dismissed given a \"good\" performance rating.)",

            " Firstly you should validate the value of P(A) and P(B) independently. For this purpose you need to think about certain events. You need to divide both cases into certain groups.\nHere's one obvious case, where performance is always good. Lets say 30 leaders were dismissed out of 600 and x were average.\nLets say, 10 out of 30 dismissed were good performers and 5 out of 10 were not. Summarily, 150 leaders got dismissd due to average performance (i.e. 50% of dismissed were average and 150 leaders got dismissed overall). Thus, the probability of a leader being dismissed given the good performance is ((100 - 50) / 150) = 66.7%.\nIf somehow, P(B) = P(C) = 0.5 and P(D) = 1, then P(B / A) = P(A / B) = 0,5 * 30 / 50 = 3 Years.\nOK, you have to screen all retired leaders in order to share a retired leader and store their retirement date. But one important point. You'll need to perform a linear search on an unsorted array in order to find the retired leader's name. So, if you do that, then the answer would be, an average of 4 Years (1 year of retirement searching and 3 years of waiting maximum). I don't see why, this should be done by using two for loops in order to find a maximum.\nHow can 5 randomly chosen people include one person whose age exactly matches the age of the oldest person drawn.

P(A) is the probability of A to be true. In this case we don't have any knowledge about that (plug in 0 to get probability). P(B given A) is the probability of event B occurence given that A is true.

Or equivalently solving for a bond price, the discount rate that leads to the interest payments when they are discounted tto the time 0. For solving the bond price, the process is simple. For an annual coupon bond with annual interest payments, you only need to solve for a geometric  sequence with three elements. The first element is 100, the second element is 8% of the first element and the last element is 8% of the second element. Using the present value formula (PV = V/r), you can solve these equations for PPT1, PPT2, and PPT3. Then the price of a bond is the summation of three terms: PPT1 + PPT2 + PPT3 = 100. Then, you need to solve for that discount factor that makes the price of a bond equals 100. Then this discount factor is the cost of Bond B. You are given this process as following: PPT1 + PPT2 + PPT3 = 100 PPT1/(1+r1) + PPT2/(1+r2) + PPT3/(1+r3) = 100 where r1, r2, r3, are the discount rates for 1 year, 2 year, and 3 year rates respectively. Solving for r2 (i.e the cost of Bond B), you have r2 = (1+r3)*[(1+r1)*100 - 100]/100*6. Doing this, you have the cost of Bond B = 7.26% that you have to write in your final sentence.

We have a significant spread between the quoted interest rate and the YTM rate. We will find out whether such distinction results in a capital gain or loss for the investor since his investments period stops at the close of year 5 when he is supposed to sell the security at market price. Such information will allow him to assess whether he will make benefit or get loss as a result and decide whether he will invest in that security or rather in another one, adjusted to his level of risk aversion and expected return.\n-).\n-).\nThe portion of the payment that goes into principal recovery is therefore 8.

Thinker Linebarger, Samuel Vandervol, Eugene Coon, and others have responded. Thinker Linebarger first pointed out that the main condition for obtaining the impossible so far is that the active pupal should be choosing at random, like tossing a coin...that, of course, does not happen in reactor-pile analysis. Nevertheless, the actualness is interesting to study. His response is: six questions, with four choices each, the chance to choose correctly is oneout of 16 for each question. Choosing all of them randomly, the chance to have in correct is on of d^2(6) = 655/321,001, i.e, 2%. This means, by probability theory, that even if one prepares this kind of test by pure randomness, on the average one of every fifty pupils will achieve the impossible...looks a lot, but in practice the active pupil will not achieve less than 2 correct answers even for larger number of questions than covered in this question, as it is not reasonable to suppose true random selection from the pupil. This is due to reactive lines from several known factors, like for questions on Monday, afterwards that are asked about it in the following week the percentage will be roughly doubled and, if the answer was wrongly given, there will appear meaningful correlation conspicuous to discern the real answer with increasing radicality the more time goes by from the previous question about that.

So, you need to find [ out that what is the difference between the present market value of the portfolio and the amount which can be a future contract sold]. So, you will calculate the difference based upon $120,349,000 (Portfolio value) and $921,219.38 (the value of the delta hedge) plus $573,333.33 (the value of the basis point hedge).\nThe difference is total to $22,796.33, which is less than the price of a single futures contract of $100,000.

            "\nExhibit 2 provides information on the Atlantic Preserves –related part of this financial exercise. Note F presented in the 2013 Annual Financial Statements contains selected factual data about the defined benefit pension plan\nThe current service cost relates to actual costs of promised benefits incurred by employees at the current level of compensation. This cost is expected to increase as the pension benefit as a function of average salary of past service is added, minus the allocated pension fee also called company’s normal cost and allocated administrative expenses.\nInterest Cost\nThe interest cost relates to the increase in the projected benefit obligation. It is determined by taking the rate attributed to the pension units, which is 80% of the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, while the latter increase by $ 1,433. Exhibit 2 records that the interest cost was $ 5,441 (not $ 4,597 reported in the note).\nActual Return on Plan Assets\nThe actual return on plan assets represents the actual return on Atlantic Preserves’ investment portfolio. It is the actual combination of total return and cash flows on assets (bonds and varying degrees of related securities). The part of the plan supporting investments may include a yield enhancement that relies on either a return on investment consistent with its overall return, but independent from any revaluation of collateral, or a greater return on investment that includes revaluation of collateral. For instance, a higher return on equity investments.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on the return on plan on assets determined frequently by modeling with the use of reasonable assumptions on future growth or income. For instance, the same pattern of return on total plan assets provided in the prior year.\nBenefits Paid to Retired Employees and Employer’s Contribution\nBenefits paid to retirees relate to the distribution of past service costs attributed to payments of retiree benefits. Adjusted to actual benefits paid to in any time period, that amount is the amount that should be attributed to pay for past service costs in that time period, and not the actual return-related pay attributed to future benefits. Employer’s contributions equal the total remuneration or pension fee of the organization as per resolution vote.\nAmortization of Past Service Costs\nPast service costs include both the impacts of hindsight and potential costs. They relate to the recognition of previous service costs determining pension units based on a special event such"

The associated details are provided below: The loan was taken on: 1/1/2017, The borrowed sum was: $100 million, The yearly interest rate: 12%, The loan period: 4 years. The repayment method includes yearly interest payments only, with the principal due at loan maturity.

            "\nThe capitalized interest is the interest that XYZ Corporation must initially pay on borrowed funds used to finance certain qualifying assets.\nThe financed assets should be economic resources that the company uses in the production process and ...\nThe capitalized interest is the interest for all the costs incurred during construction, design, and development of an asset funded by a loan. It should be noted that this criterion applies mainly for constructions within the meaning of IFRS.\nor.\nThe capitalized interest primarily pertains to the interest for all the costs incurred during construction, design, and development of an asset funded by a loan. It should be noted that this criterion applies mainly for constructions within the meaning of IFRS.\nAs the manufacturing lanes should be treated as a major project during 2017, corresponding to the acquisition of a long-term asset, but are equally financed by borrowed funds that generate an interest expense, the company will obligatorily capitalized interest. Therefore, the total capitalized interest paid over the loan period is considered to be equal to the principal payment, paid at the end of the contract.\nWe typically use a flat interest rate when relevant:\n1. We calculate using the beginning value of an asset or liability at the beginning of a period.\n2. We use the daily imputed interest rate of an asset or liability.\nSince the interest rate for XYZ Corporation is based on the value of an asset at the beginning of the financing period (or at the end of a period for which an amount has been capitalized and there were no additions to or reductions of costs relating to the asset for which interest is calculated) AND the ending value of the asset or liability is equal to the face value of the loan at the end of the financing period, we need to use the flat interest rate to be used for capitalized interest calculation.\nIn this specific case, we made the interest payment each year at a flat 12% interest rate (which is the annual amount of interest payable according to the loan agreement). So after 5 years we must repay the loan and the total amount of interest, including the principal interest, is $100,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 102,000,000 dollars.\nThe answer is 102000000."

I won't criticize the computation effectiveness of CAPM; however, it helps accelerating our thinking speed not to act and reason like academics. You don't incorporate irrelevant histories.\n3.

The public company's tax rate is 35%, its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.9, and its equity beta is 1.75.\n\nThe pure-play approach assumes that two firms in the same industry have similar debt-to-equity ratios, but they might have different tax rates and equity betas. To determine the private company's equity beta, we can adjust the public company's beta for the debt-to-equity ratio and tax rate differences.\n\nLet's assume the private company's beta is pg.\n\nUsing the cross-sectional equivalence theorem, we can write the following equation:\n\npe = (pg * ppub) / (1 - ppub)\n\nwhere pe is the private company's equity beta and ppub is the public company's equity beta.\n\n1.75 = (pg * 1.00) / (1 - 0.9)\n\nSolving for pg:\n\npg = 1.75 * (1 - 0.9) / 1\npg = 1.75 * 0.1 / 1\npg = 0.175\n\nTherefore, the projected equity beta for the private firm using the pure-play approach and the data obtained from its publicly traded rival is 0.175.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.175."

So now we use the same formula for the calculation of present sum and we find $1,400 which we then reduce by certain interest payments: 16 (December) + 56 (years) = 72, so the amount remaining is $14,640 and average payment (January to June) of $11,700. The total payment would be $($14,640 – $11,700)$1 = $2,940. Therefore the total value for this issuer's bond will be $2,000,000 + (5 years @ 7%, or $20,053,099.73) + $2,940 + (7 years @ 7%, or $102,413,048.73) + $3,501.40 + (13 months @ 3.75%, or $45,428,713.10) = $148,444,380,690.00."

            "\nThe duration of swap is 3 years as it has quarterly payments. In order to reduce portfolio duration from 5.5 to 4.5, new duration of the portfolio with quarter discounted coupons would equal 3.5. There is a change of 0.5 (Duration added = 3.5-5.5).\nThe duration of the entire portfolio with quarterly discounted interest rate swaps added equals 0.5 + 3.5 = 4 years. As 3/4 of the 3.5 duration of original portfolio leads to adjustable duration of 0.5, therefore, fourth of the fixed duration of interest rate swap greater than 3 years to be added 0.5 brings portfolio duration to 3.5 years.\nTherefore, the duration of the interest rate swap = 4/3 * 3.5 = 4.7. The duration of the interest rate swap is -2.125, so the negative sign reflects interest rate swap with a quarterly coupon of a bond with negative duration.\nNow calculate the notional amount of interest rate swap by multiplying duration and market value of original portfolio. Distance measured for 5.5 - 3.5 = 2. The notional amount of the swap is equal to the market value of the portfolio divided by the distance.\nDistance = 3.5 + 2 = 5.5 years = 5 + 1/2. Therefore, the interest rate swap has a full year semi-annually and it has 0.5 years paid quarterly.\nThe transaction value of the interest rate swap is found by dividing $10,000,000 (market value of the portfolio) by total duration (5.5). Duration * Transaction price = Market value of portfolio.\nThat is, modified duration of swap/2 years duration* transaction price = market value of portfolio. That is, -2.125 / (2 *5.5) * transaction price = $10,000,000. Thus, transaction price = $10,000,000 / (-2.125)/(0.5 * 11/2) = $5,000,000.

The profit made is the difference between the cost to purchase the Y options, ($10.25) X 72, or $363.73, and the foregone income from the sale of the X options ($38) X 1,000, ($363.73) which generates a small loss of ($16.27). Finally, we find the profit on this hedging strategy if it lasts for exactly 1 month and if it's held to maturity by subtracting from the hedge cost/profit the value of the loan we will have to make to create this hedge.

To solve for a such that A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the accumulated amount at the end of the period, P is the principal, a is the payment, r is the rate, expressed as a decimal figure, and n is the number of periods. In this case, A=myi, r=0.0006 (0.06% expressed as a decimal), i=1/12, and n=months. This is a quadratic equation and solving for a this way will prove to be troublesome. To solve this problem, let us first get i/n out of the interest expressed as A/(P(1 + i/n))*n. This leaves us with A = P[1 + i/(n)]. You may already notice by removing the effect of number of periods, we have our answer. To test this, consider a case that involves 3 payments. Solution: A = P[1 + i/n] * n = P[1 + .06% * 3] * 3 = P[1 + $0.03] * 3 = P[1 + $0.03] * $0.03 = A = P[1 + $0.03] = P = A + P($0.03).

Say the investor borrowed 135 stocks and bought 235 stocks. In this case, the investor has $50 * 135 = $6750 worth of borrowed stocks (remember, borrowed stocks have 100% leverage). Combined with the investor's 100 personal stocks, the investor has $6750 + $5000 = $11750 total stocks. $11750 / 2.5 leverage ratio we have $4699.99 for the original cash value of the investor. This means that we have $4699.99 of borrowed money, so the investor needs to pay $4699.99 * 0.06 = $281.99 in six-months' worth of interest.Since we're ignoring differences in costs, we should assume the investor didn't have to pay any transaction expenses. The final answer is the difference in profits and interest payments: Profits = {Final share price} x {Shares sold} − {Original share price} x {Shares purchased initially} = {60 * 200} − {50 * 200} = 10000 Sales revenue = − 10000 Profits earned 10000 = 0 SOLUTION: The final answer is 0.  → The answer is 0."

Since the rate is 4% and the liabilities accumulate at 4% too, the value of the assets should account for 36.752 (they accumulated 300.00 at start)\nThus, you can use a formula to calculate the required contributions to the retirement fund during the 40 years of work average assets at retirement / average annual wage 48000/10095.554=4.75% Now, on a financial basis, you could distribute this amount in the following way: The calculations are performed in real terms in order to rule out the so called inflation bias (a real increase in wages would cause distortions). In order to avoid the Bond value bias you could state that there is not any bank performing that calculation (a tie ratio of 25% / 75% should be accomplished between the savings side and the\npension side of the fund) If there are 100 workers, the fund will have saved 121.810 Euros (slightly lower savings than liabilities of 123.642 Euros).\nTherefore, the answer is 4.75 How should"

That means the closing balance for company is $1524 - $1424. That is, $100\n\nTherefore, the closing balance for the company is $100\n\nTherefore, the closing balance for the company is $100\n\nThe answer would be $100.\n\nThese are just two examples.

An increase by .25% of 103.28 or a decrease by 0.25% of 100.81 yields the bond value change percentage of [(103.28 - 101.45) / 101.45] or [(101.45 - 100.81) / 101.45], which = 1.82%.

From this we can see, TVPI at the close of the most recent year was 140. However, we are actually asked for TVPI ratio. This is with respect to TVPI at the close of the most recent year with respect to current cumulative paid-in capital that is 140/90 = 56%.

A flat interest rate curve connotes that the market expects interest rates to remain at current levels and the market participants cannot determine accurately whether long term interest rates will increase or decrease. Fortunately, the concept of implied volatility and interest rate risk allows us to evaluate the potential of the interest rate change for our position under review. The bond position under review with a value of $ 100 million and a modified duration of eight years would see its value change by $ 800,000 if interest rates were to appreciate by 25 basis points. We can obtain that amount of change by multiplying the modified duration of the position by the change in the interest rates. The duration times the 25 basis points yields a price change of $ 8,000,000. As such, our position would lose $ 800,000 in value if interest rates were to increase by 25 basis points.\n\nWhen you evaluate the best answer options above, you can agree that all of them are incorrect. The first option does not capture the change in the position as interest rates appreciate instead, it underscores the change in the position as interest rates depreciate. Option two asserts that the value of the position changes by $8 million which should be the total appreciation of the position and not the change. Option three submits that there is a decrease in the position's value which is incorrect given the scenario in the question. Only option four is correct for the bond price move up is given by multiplied the modified duration by the increase in interest rates which is 8 x 0.025 = $ 8, 000, 000 ( $8 million).\n→ 2021-04-04 12:35, Nathaniel answered\n→ 2021-04-06 08:49, Nathaniel edited\n→ 2021-04-06 08:51, Nathaniel edited → 2021-04-06 09:52, Michaela Leeedited"

            "\nHere's how you could use some fundamental concepts to start answering the question:\n1. We could define an exact formula for annual-pay modified duration (or better yet, just look it up in the text book and refer to\nthe exact formula). It looks like this:\nFor 100 at par, with 15% (coupon / 2) coupons, modified duration is 5.70\n2. We could also use relative delta formula: % change / 100 x modified duration.\nSo if 25 basis points is 0.25%, it's 0.25 / 100 x 5.70 = 0.01425% = -14.25 basis points.\n3. Similarly, when you are asked about the price change, we can use % change = % change applied to yield / YTM = -0.24 x 1 = -0.24%.\n4. Now, since the current bond price is at par, we can answer the first part of the question by saying that the approximate change to the price\nof the at par bond would be a downward, -0.24% change, or if they make a higher 25-basis point to the yield, the 5-year bond would decrease in value by 0.24%.\n5. If the put price goes up, so will the new modified duration (as calculated in step 2), so the price will decrease more than -0.24%.\n6. Thus, the more accurate answer is -0.24%. However, if you wanted to give them the right answer, you could say it's -0.24%, but it will be a bit less because the modified duration will creep up a bit unless they also adjust the yield curve to be more steeply sloping upwards (with some other non-negligible yield curve shapes)."

Indian cuisine is not a part of the menu of any of the college and hence not an influencing factor. The student to faculty ratio is 1 and 11 respectively for Colleges2 and College1.

Given that for net income reported in the balance sheet, NI (or losses) should affect Retained earnings. Hence, given that retained earnings in balance sheet - retained earnings in previous year = (depreciation + amortization + dividends + net financing cash flow), we can deduce the answer. The Net income of the company is $56 million, dividends paid are $50 million (cash outflow). Thus, we can deduce 5 + Net Financing Cash Flow = 51. Therefore, the Net Financing Cash Flow is $46M. Not to mention, depreciation and amortization are in effect 'non cash charge' not considered in cash flow from financing activity.\n....\nTherefore, the answer is 46$"

This IS screwed, I'm not even getting anything remotely near on Computer, and I did it correctly. I'd assume it's actually below $2000., so I'm screwed. :/ Title: Machine Shady Non-cash Flow Haiku Step by step Breakdown.\nI'm not sure what this question is even asking. I would start with finding the accounting straight line, then value of machine for first year as seen in example ( 120 000 machine , 60000 old accounts for depreciations on givens , new additions are 60000 - old price ( which is always given ) * tax rate.\nThen I saw a random answer and figured out I worked tax totals past 1st year, so I just changed the 60,000 to 30,000, and that basically almost got me to 2000, so I'm gonna guess $2000 is the correct answer.... Title: What would the non-cash flow terms be for a Depreciation Expense.\nTo be honest, I'm pretty Confuse on what to do. Also, just saw that 2000 is somehow the answer?
