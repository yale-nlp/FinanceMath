We can examine the values on the right side of the table; the 1.5-year bond will mature and be redeemed in period 3 and will earn a forward rate of 2.30% annually. If an investor purchases this bond for $100 today and holds it for 1.5 years, the investor will receive $100*(1+0.023)=$102.30 in 1.5 years.\n\nSimilarly, if the investor holds on to this 1.5-year bond for another 0.5 years until maturity, they would receive $100*(1+0.027)=$102.70. Since the investor has to hold this bond for two years to receive $102.70, then an investor would require a 5% annualized return in order to be indifferent between receiving $102.70 in two years and $100 today. This means that a $100 2.5-year treasury bond should sell for $\\frac{100}{1+0.05}=$96.15 today.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 96.15."

According to Pierre, the asset-based assessment is approximately $41,000,000, which is calculated by deducting the current assets from the sum of fixed assets."

The offer from Peterson values Heartland at an enterprise worth of USD40.6 billion, which includes USD4.3 billion of existing Heartland debt. In order to finance the consideration of USD55 in cash along with 2.25 Peterson shares for each Heartland share, Peterson intends to issue 104 million new shares and will raise approximately USD26 billion in new debt, with the remaining being funded by cash on hand. Once the deal has closed, Peterson anticipates having an outstanding debt of nearly USD62 billion. Before the acquisition, Peterson had 1.096 billion shares in circulation, each trading at USD125.

The offer value of USD40.6B for Heartland translates to a price of 2.75 / USD40.6B = 6.86% of the total consideration per Heartland share. We can estimate the market value of Heartland by figuring the difference between the offer value and existing debt assuming the debt value equals the book value: 40.6 - 4.3 = 36.3, so each Heartland share is worth 36.3 / 2.75 = 13.08% of the total consideration. Taking this into account, the share issuance for Peterson from the deal values at: 55 + 13.08 = 68.08% of the total consideration, so the share issuance values at 68.08 * 104 million = USD7.12 billion. We can figure out the debt issuance value by subtracting the share issuance value from the total consideration: 55 + 2.75 - 7.12 = 37.72. Remark that post deal Peterson would have debt outstanding of 62 + 37.72 = 99.72 billion, so the ratio of debt to equity would be 99.72 / 1.216 = 0.85. This means the ratio has decreased by 0.15 considering the deal. Therefore, the answer is 0.15."

At the end of 2007, Nutmeg’s average cost was 10 + 11 / 2 = €11 per unit. During the second year, the cost of sales amounts to the cost of the purchases plus the lower of cost or market for the sales. For the sales of 2007, this means 45,000 * 22 = €990,000. The total cost of sales is then 450,000 + 990,000 = €1,440,000. In 2008, the lower of cost or market for the sales of 2007 is the 2007 sales price of €22 multiplied by the 2008 sales quantity of 40,000, namely 22 * 40,000 = €880,000. The cost of sales in 2008 is then the cost of purchases in 2008 plus the lower of cost or market for the sales of 2007, namely 1,440,000 + 880,000 = €2,320,000. The total cost of sales for 2008 is therefore 2,320,000 + 450,000 = €3,100,000. The cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is 3,100,000 / 5,500,000 = 54.5%. Therefore, the answer is 54.5%."

            " First, we need to calculate the present value of the bond. Since the bond pays annually and has 3 years to maturity, then the number of payment periods is 3. So if the bond pays 5% annually, then the period payment is 5% / 100 * 1000 EUR = EUR 50. If we have 3 years to go until the bond matures, and the 1-year government bond offers a return of 6%, then the present value of the bond would be 1000 EUR * exp(- (6% / 100) * 3) - 1000 EUR = 926.9367 EUR. Since the bond pays annually, the present value needs to be divided by the number of periods, which is 3 in this case. This gives a present value of 308.3013 per period. Since the bond pays EUR 50 every period, then dividing the per period value by the payment per period gives the number of periods until the next coupon payment, which in this case is 6.47 periods. Using the same idea, we would know that if the bond hasn't reached maturity and is 6.47 periods away from the next coupon payment, then when it does reach maturity it would be 20.49 periods away from its final coupon payment. Multiplying the number of periods until the next coupon by the annual payment gives the next coupon payment of 309.5 EUR. If the 20-year bond has 20 periods left until maturity, and it has an 8% three-year government bond, then the present value would be 1000 EUR * exp(- (8% / 100) * 20) - 1000 EUR = 652.06061 EUR. Again, since the bond pays annually, then dividing this present value by the number of periods until maturity gives 65.206 EUR per payment period. Dividing the present value per period by the payment per period gives the number of periods until the next payment, which in this is 17.039 periods. So in 17.039 periods, the bond will reach maturity and give its final payment of 65.206 EUR.\"Therefore, the answer is 65.206.\""

In this case, since the return is between 8 and 11 percent, we need to find out the likelihood of the return if the mean is 8 and the standard deviation is 14. In this case, the calculation will be between 8+1*14(=28) and 8-1*14(=-7).

The formula to calculate the present value of an annuity is PV=FVT/ (1+T*r) where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, T is the number of periodic payments, r is the interest rate and T is the time in years to the next cash flow. So, let's try to find out the meaning of each value in the formula based on the given information. According to the information given, the notional principal of the fixed leg of the interest rate swap is 9,000,000 and the term is 1 year (so T is 1). The swap rate is annualized (so T is 1/year so 1*year=1), and we are looking for the fixed swap rate (so r is fixed). So, the formula becomes PV=FVT/(1+T*r). Now, let's plug in the numbers: PV=9,000,000/(1+1*fixed). Ok, let's assume that the fixed rate is 5%, so the present value is 9,000,000/(1+1*5%)=9,000,000/1.05=8,488,888. Wait a minute, Michael can't agree on this rate as the present value of 9,000,000 with a fixed rate of 5% is only 8,488,888. He thinks that the present value of 9,000,000 with a fixed rate of 5% should be more than 9,000,000. Therefore, the annualized fixed swap rate is: 5.05%."

            " First of all, what does leverage mean? Leverage means using someone else's money to make more money on top of someone else's money. The more leverage you apply, the more risk you expose. If you buy something using so much leverage and the value of the bought item you are leveraging drops, you might end up owing several times more than what you initially used to buy that item. The internet-based trading company has set a limit on the maximum of leverage ratio which is the maximum amount of risk you can expose if you want to buy something using leverage. In the problem, the limit equals 55%. The minimum margin requirement is the money needed for the trading company to accept your transaction. So, the minimum margin requirement must be used as collateral to offset the risk of your position. However, it does not necessarily mean that the maximum leverage ratio you can apply is equal to 100% minus the minimum margin requirement. You also need to keep in mind that the minimum margin requirement is already being used as collateral. The part of the minimum margin requirement which can be used for leverage has to be calculated. In simple terms, if you apply leverage, you multiply the collateral by a ratio of leverage. If the collateral is not enough to cover the risk of the position created by leverage, the trading company will ask for extra money. Think of it as a loan. In the case of our problem, let's calculate 55% of the minimum margin requirement. If the minimum margin requirement is a number x, then 0.55x is the most you can use as leverage from the minimum margin requirement. For example, let's say the minimum margin requirement is 50k USD, then the most you can leverage from it is $27,500. That doesn't mean you are allowed to buy a position worth $27,500. As we have already mentioned, the amount of leverage you can apply has to be calculated on collateral. What is left from the minimum margin requirement which you can use as collateral is equal to 55% of 50k - 27,500 = $22,500. Now you can apply leverage on the collateral like this: total leverage ratio = ((leverage ratio from minimum margin requirement) + (leverage ratio from the rest of the margin requirement))/2. And the total leverage ratio can't be higher than 55%. In our example, let's say we want to buy something for 100k USD with leverage. Then we'd have to apply the rest of the leverage from the total amount available for leverage, which in"

The retirement fund is planning to use a futures contract priced at $250,000 to raise the beta from 0.9 to 1.2 for a span of one month. The futures contract has a beta of 0.95. After one month, the return of the stock market is 5%, the market value of the stock collection becomes $6,250,000, and the cost of the futures contract is $262,000.

The stock value increased by 5% in 1 month so its new value is 6,000,000 * 5% / 100 = $300,000. With the value of the futures contract increasing by $31,000 the new value of the stock collection excluding futures is 6,250,000 - 31,000 = $6,219,000. The beta of the stock collection excluding futures is 6,219,000 / 300,000 = 21. If the futures contract had no beta the total beta of the fund would be 21 * 0.95 = 20.15 , since it has a beta of 0.95 the total beta is 20.15 * 0.95 = 19.4375. The beta of the stock element of the fund is the total beta of the fund minus the beta of the futures contract 19.4375 - 0.95 = 19.4375 - 0.95 = 19.2875. Therefore, the answer is 19.2875."

That means the anticipated return of the fund will be the weighted average of the expected return on each of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index. In general, the return on the fund will be the sum of the total return of each of the 500 stocks, and to get the average return we divide that sum by 500. The total return for each stock include both the stock price change and the expected dividend yield. Since we are just concerned with the price change, we need to subtract the expected dividend yield from the total expected return.\n\nAs the name suggests, a synthetic fund is a fund that is synthetically created, meaning that the fund manager creates the fund by buying a combination of instruments instead of buying the actual stocks in the underlying index. In this case, our fund manager will buy futures contracts.\nLet’s first calculate the expected return of the S&P 500. The risk-free rate is 3%, and for simplicity we will assume that it remains unchanged during the next three months. Therefore, the expected return of the S&P 500 is 3% for the next three months.\nNext, we need to determine the expected return of each component stock in the index. The S&P 500 consists of 500 of the largest company stocks, so we assume each stock’s return is normally distributed with a mean of the S&P 500’s return and a standard deviation of 20%. That means that about 68% of the stocks will have a return within one standard deviation of the average return, and about 95% of the stocks will have a return within two standard deviations.\nWe need the number of standard deviations by which the return on each stock will be less than the return on the S&P 500. In other words, we need to determine the number of standard deviations that, when subtracted from the average return on each stock, will result in a return that is less than the S&P 500’s return of 3%. Since we are working with a probability of 95%, we will use the following formula: (1 – 0.95)^(-1/2) = 1.64. The returns on roughly 95% of the stocks will be within one standard deviation of the S&P 500 return, and the returns on roughly 64% of the stocks will be within"

Libor is the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is the rate of interest at which banks are prepared to lend unsecured funds to one another in the London interbank market. We can assume the 1.5 times Libor is always rounded up to the nearest integer which is 2. So the coupon rate of floating part of the transaction will be 5%+2=7. In the beginning, the firm has received 1.5 million dollars = 1 million principals (on which the firm paid 1.5 million in coupon) + 0.5 million coupons. And 5% of 1 million dollars principal is 50 thousand dollars which is the fixed payment the firm needs to pay. So, the firm has received 1.5 million dollars + 0.5 million dollars - 50 thousand dollars = 1 million dollars. In this point we have to make a critical assumption that the firm has used this 1 million dollars to purchase the fixed rate bond, so we can continue with our calculations and answer the question. Moving forward, we need to determine the present value of the floating rate bond. There are different formulae that financial experts usually use for different situations, but for the sake of simplicity, we can use a very popular formula of Present value of an annuity due: PV = (FV / (1 + i)^n) *(1-(1+i)^{-n}) where: PV is present value, FV is future value, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. So in our case: 1 000 000 = (1 000 000 * (1 + i)^2) *(1-(1+i)^{-2}) where i is 7%. Solving for i gives us: 7.1428571428571 So the present value of the floating rate bond is worth 919 262.8571428571. The firm initially has received 1 000 000 and will need to pay 5 000 000 in fixed payments so it's tied down for 919 262.8571428571 in present value. We need to determine the present value of the 'counter'-transaction' the firm partaken.

In other words duracion modificada measures the average time until the various future cash flows are received. It measures the average sensitivity of every period to interest rates. That means, if our bond has a mod Duration of 9.6, we have to somehow weight the duration of every year so that the sum is equal to 9.6. A simple way to do that would be by working with an average term to maturity of 10 years. That would translate to a sensitivity of each year of 0.96/10 = 0.096. Based on this if we decrease the yield by 90 basis points, which is equivalent to 90 / 100 * 100% = 9%, we will have a decrease in the future cash flow in an average of 0.096 * 9% = 0.86% every year.

Thus, the down node value is\n$28 * (1 + ($26 - $28) / 2) + $30 * (1 + ($30 - $28) / 2) = $30 * 1.02 = $30.60\n\nStep 4: Determine the put option value.\nThe put option value is the difference between the up node value and down node value. In other words, it is a risk-neutral valuation. It can be computed as follows\n$31.60 - $30.60 = $1"

The amount of the final payment at maturity is equal to the principal ($1,000) plus the present value of all future interest payments. Using the YTM as the discount rate (the interest rate that equates the present value of future cash flows with the future cash flows), the present value of the bond's future interest payments is equal to $1,000 (the bond's principal). At a 6% YTM, the present value of $60 annual payments forever is equal to $1,000, so the present value of the bond's future interest payments over the next 10 years is equal to $100.

This is because in 225 days there must be at least 225 * 2 = 450 occurrences, and the observed losses need to be bi-daily so the smallest frequency of the occurrence of those losses would be 450 / 2 = 225.\n\nStep 2:\nIf the frequency of loss is bi-daily, there is only 1 possible combination to make the 1 - day 99% VaR exceedance happen in 1 year. That is, loss occurs on day 1 and day 3, loss occurs on day 2 and day 4, ..., loss occurs on day 222 and day 224, and loss occurs on day 223 and day 225.\n\nStep 3:\nSince loss occurs bi-daily, the 99% VaR exceedance has to occur on the days with the 99th percentile of loss magnitudes. Let X be the random variable representing the loss magnitude. Denote the set of days with loss as D and the set of 99% VaR exceedance days as ED. Assume that the magnitudes of loss are ordered as X(D1) ≤ X(D2) ≤ ... ≤ X(Dn) , where Di ∈ D are distinct days and n is the size of set D. Because ED is the set of days with magnitudes of loss in the 99th percentile, |ED| = k and k is the 100 - percentile rank of the loss magnitude X(Dk), where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Since loss must occur bi-daily, we have 2 * |ED| = 2k is the 100 - percentile rank of the loss magnitude X(D2k), where 1 ≤ 2k ≤ 2n. It follows that |ED| is the 50 - percentile rank of the loss magnitude X(Dk).\n\nStep 4:\nSince the size of the set of 99% VaR exceedance days is the maximum the model can miscalculate, the number of days with loss must be no larger than 143 (= 225 * 99 / 100).\n\nStep 5:\nTherefore, maximum possible number of loss days exceeding the 1 - day 99% VaR in a 1 - year backtest is 143. More precisely, there must be exactly 143 days with loss, and all the 143 loss days must be the days with loss magnitudes in the 99th percentile.

This difference of 1% is called \"Database yield\", and is usually defined as: Yield - market interest rate.\nLet's say an investor is able to sell those bonds back to the corporation at the end of the year, then the investor would receive $1,000,000 * 6% = $60,000.

Returning to the original problem, let the number of observations that are not between 32 and 116 be x. 64 + x must equal 100%, following the total probability theorem. x must be 36%. Thus, the answer is 36%."

Economically, revenues are earned when the goods are sold, regardless of when the cash is received, hence the revenues in this situation should be reported in the year 2009. To determine under which prism accrued basis falls, time-wise, we have to examine when the expenses are recorded. The cost of goods sold for the products sold in 2009 were incurred in 2009, so they should be reported as an expense in the 2009 financial statements.

When choosing not to allocate pension contribution to pension, the total asset becomes 24130 - 66 = 24164, and liability remains the same while equity becomes 6,570 - 66 = 6534. (Notice that we just show the final numbers, do not get distracted by the details, we only use it for computation later.)\nAccording to the table, ABC's financing cash flow is 2,323 this year, while operating cash flow is -1,087, thus free cash flow is 2,323 - 1,087 = 1,236. (We ignore inflation of health care cost for now. If you compute the number and find it negative, just follow what we do next.)\nWe know ABC's equity is 6534 and the free cash flow is 1,236, so the debt-to-equity ratio should be 24164 / 6534 = 36.5.\nBack to the number before we ignore inflation, if we assume health care inflation rises by 100 basis points and ABC decides to fully pass it onto customers, and the customers refuse to pay so ABC's operating cash flow drops to -1087 - 100 = -1287. If health care inflation drops by 100 basis point and ABC decides to fully absorb the cost, then the company's operating cash flow increases to -1087 + 100 = -987. ABC's free cash flow drops to 1236 - 100 = 1136 with the first scenario and increases to 1236 + 100 = 1336 with the second scenario. (Pay attention to the signs in front of the numbers, they determine the directions of your computations.)\nSo the debt-to-equity ratio should be 24164 / 6576 = 36 with the first scenario and 24164 / 6534 = 36.5 with the second scenario.

            " First, let's understand how the interest rate affects the level of savings. When the interest rate goes up, individuals would like to save more for a higher interest rate. So the level of savings increases. Likewise, when the interest rate goes down, the level of savings drops. That's why we have the IS-LM model.\n\nIf the real interest rate is 3%, holding everything else constant, the level of savings would increase to 500 + 0.30 * Y - 25 * 3 = 375. Likewise, an upsurge in state expenditure to 2,000 would increase the government budget balance from 1,000 to 2,000, causing the level of aggregate demand to upsurge to 2,500 + 0.80 * Y - 250 + 2,000 = 4,250. And when aggregate demand increases, output and income would increase as well. Next let's see how the level of consumption would change as it accounts for nearly 70% of aggregate demand here. Given a fixed savings rate of 20% ($500 / $2,500 = 20%), the idea of consumption would move left by a 20% distance from C to C -. The consumption level thus drops to C = 2,500 - 0.20 * 2,500 = 1,500. And with a 30% marginal tax rate, the surge in income would be taxed away by 1 - 0.30 = 0.70. The final surge in consumption would be 1,500 - 250 = 1,250. Overall, aggregate demand has increased by 4,250 - 1,250 = 3,000 and induced an output surge 3,000 / 0.8 = $3,750."

            "\n\nStep 1: Under the current circumstance, the executive can buy a 30 put option (close to ATM). To see this, a 30 put gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell one share of stock at $30 per share at any time during the life of the contract. Clearly, this is essentially the same as the current situation in which the executive can sell one share of stock at $30.\n\nStep 2: Alternatively, we can calculate this put option price using the binomial tree. When there is only one period left until expiration, the stock can be worth either $30.8 or $29.2 with equal probability (assuming continuous compounding of the risk-free rate). We know the hedge ratio is the ratio of the number of shares to the number of options. Here, we can buy one share for $30 and sell one put, so we know the hedge ratio is one share per option, or 1/($30/$30.8) = 1/1.12 = 0.9262.\n\nStep 3: Now we can calculate the cost of the put option. We need to buy one share at $30 and sell one put at $30, so the cost is ($30 + $30) * 0.9262 = $58.4.\n\nStep 4: Finally, we find the delta of this put option. When the stock price moves down by $1 to $29, the value of the put option will move down by $1.8 to $27.2. The new stock price ($29) divided by the old put price ($27.2) gives us a delta of 0.6 (= 29/27.2).\n\nTo summarise: Hedge ratio: 0.9262; Cost of put option: $58.4; Delta: 0.6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.9262."

A pupil not answering three or more questions correctly, means that he has answered less than two questions correctly.

Solving for $v$ gives us $v= GMT+b/(1+b)$ so now the equation is $(1-.9)(1.067)(1.14)(1-)=av+a/(1+a)$. To solve for $a$ we multiply and rearrange again $(1-.9)(1.067)(1.14)(1-)=avg+a/1.14$. Solving our final equation gives us the average return on investment $avg= 14\\%$ of $9.48 \\%=1.3248$ and with the formula $v=GMT+b/(1+b)$ we get the geometric mean return on investment $GMT= 1.3248 + .0955 = 1.4951$ or 14.95%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.4951"

            "\n\nStep 1: Break down the problem into more digestible components.\n\nWe're dealing with future cash flows, so let's find the present value of each individual year. To do this, we can find the present value of 1 year, and then multiply it by the number of years.\n\nStep 2: Find the present value of 1 year.\n\nWe know that the present value of an amount in the future is equal to the future amount divided by the discount rate. We also know that 6.5% is compounded monthly, so the effective monthly discount rate is 0.065 / (1 + 0.065) = 0.0617. If we take 1 year, which is 12 months, and divide the future amount of €1,200 by the effective monthly discount rate, we get: €1,200 / 0.0617 = €1,973.22.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the present value per year by the number of years.\n\nIf we want to find the present value of the 5 years, we just need to multiply the present value of 1 year by the number of years: €1,973.22 * 5 = €9,861.10.\n\nStep 4: Add the value of the first period payment.\n\nDon't forget that the first payment is also part of the agreement, so we need to add it to the five year present value. The first payment is equal to €1,200, so the final answer is: €9,861.10 + €1,200 = €10,061.10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10061.10"

The range of Y that you specify in the problem, 12 to 61, is inclusive so we need to check if Y can take a value of 12 or 61. For Y to be 12, it would have to be equal to 12 - 0.5 * 14 = 8.5 since the value 12 is at the mean of the distribution. For Y to be 61, it would have to be equal to 61 + 0.5 * 14 = 75.5.

This amount is known as Conversion factor, which is the amount of the CTD bond that will be delivered if the price of the portfolio falls by 1 basis point.

We find the number of futures contracts John needs to sell by dividing the decline of value John needs for his portfolio, which is 10 basis points because John wants to fully safeguard the portfolio, by the decline of value per futures contract, which is 9 basis points.

(b) if the bonds issued are beyond $2.5 million, assuming that $2.5 million will be issued at a yield of 13.65% then the total yield for the rest of the bonds will be 16% - 13.65% = 2.35%. Playpoint can issue $10 million bonds with face value but only $2.5 million in new bonds so the remaining amount of bonds to be issued is $10 million - $2.5 million = $7.5 million. If scenario (b) applies then the cost of bonds will be  $7.5 million * 2.35% = $1,787,500. Note that: scenario (a) has a lower cost compared to scenario (b) thus the total cost of bonds is $343,750.

Therefore, the change in sustaining margin from day 1 to day 2 is 20,000 * (-1) = -20,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if a trader’s position is unprofitable, the initial margin will be reduced by an amount equal to the unapplied profit in that position. Initial margin cannot be reduced below a certain maintenance level. Therefore, the change in the initial margin from day 1 to day 2 is -20,000 - 3,200 = -25,200.\n\nThe sum of initial and change in initial margin is therefore $-25200 + 3200 = -22000$.\n\nChange in variation margin\n\nThe change in variation margin which is equal to the difference between the variation margin and the change in the initial margin is therefore 22000 - 25200 = $-3200$ .\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3200."

            " In the first year, the dividend will increase by $0.50 * 0.25 = $0.125. So the next year's dividend would be $0.5 + $0.125 = $0.625. The following year's dividend would be $0.625 * 1.1 = $0.699. Suppose the corporation's stock has a beta of 1.2, and the market's required rate of return is 8%. Then based on the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return R for the corporation's stock should be: R = Beta * Rm + Alpha, where Rm is the market's required rate of return and Alpha is the risk premium. The stock's required rate of return would be: R = 1.2 * 8% + ? = 9.6%. Considering that in year three and onwards, the dividend will increases by 5%, therefore the following years' dividends would be: Year 3: $0.699 * 1.05 = $0.733; Year 4: $0.733 * 1.05 = $0.759. Since there will be infinite years in the future, the expected value of infinite years' dividends would be: $0.733 + $0.759 + $0.7 _ + ... = Infinity * $0.733. From the current year to the infinite years, the sum of the dividends' present value would be: Infinity * $0.733 / (1 + 9.6%) = $10.86. According at the beginning, the company has paid out $0.5 * 1 = $0.5 the dividend per share, then from year 1 - 3, the total dividend paid out per share would be: $0.5 + $0.625 + $0.699 + $0.733 = $2.794. The corporation's intrinsic value could be: $10.86 + $2.794 = $13.7. Therefore, the answer is 13.7."

So, a zero-coupon bond with a 4% yield to maturity has a present value of $100 at a 4% discount rate. This means that each cash flow is being discounted by 4% and thus when we compound that discount rate we will get a present value of $100. Like wise, a zero-coupon bond with a 5% yield to maturity has a present value of $100 at a 5% discount rate. Therefore, the yield for the one year zero-coupon bond ($100/(1+.04)) is calculated by compounding the yield to maturity of the two-year zero coupon bond (.04 * .05 = .2). Similarly, the yield for the one year zero-coupon bond ($100/(1+.06)) is calculated by compounding the yield to maturity of the three-year zero coupon bond (.04 * .06 = .24).

By substituting the former identity into the latter, we get C + I + G + (X - M) - T = C, so T = Y - C. Now we can build a multipler from this identity. We have Y / C = 1 + T / C if we solve for Y. We now want to solve for the multiplier which means we replace C with C * m where m is the multiplier. Therefore Y / (C * m) = 1 + T / (C * m) which gives us Y / (C * m) - 1 - T / (C * m) = 0. We can solve for m by calculating - 1 - T / (C * m). Substituting our earlier identities, we have - 1 - T / (C * m) = - 1 - (Y - C) / (C * m) = - 1 - Y / (C * m) which means we have 1 + T / C = 1 + Y / C or T / C = Y / C - 1.

A protective put is a options strategy employed to limit loss on a long stock position by selling a put with a strike price below the current market price. In this example, the hedge fund manager is to use protective put to limit loss on a long stock position. \n\nIf he sells a 23 put, which means he agrees to buy 1000 shares of stock at $23 per share, he is also obligated to pay $1800 for this contract. That means he has $1800 loss upfront. If the stock price drops below $23 per share, the put option he sold will be exercised, and he will need to buy 1000 shares of stocks at $23 and sell it in the market at a lower price, which result in a loss. The maximum loss for this strategy is the difference between the strike price of the put option he sold, which is $23 in this case, and the stock's current price, which is $25.1. That means the maximum loss is $2.1 per share, or $2100 for 1000 shares.

We can see there's another bid order from Jeff to buy 400 shares, limit £19.93. Even though Jeff's limit price is higher than John's sell price, there's still a chance for them to trade if Jeff is willing to lower his limit price, because there's a possibility that Jeff cancels part of his order and matches with John's order directly.\nAssuming Jeff canceled 100 shares from his original order, he will match with John's sell order directly at the price of £19.83, since they have the same limit price. Then John will sell his shares to Jeff for £19.83 per share, for a total of £1983.\nThere's still 900 shares left from John's original sell order, which hasn't been traded yet.

Then John will sell his shares for £1999 for the remaining 900 shares, and he will get a total of £1999 * 900 = £179900 after this trade.\nIn a word, since John's sell order hasn't been fully traded, his average price should be the total amount he received after the trade divided by the number of shares he sold.

We average the value at Time 1 and Time 2 and use the geometric average of the two coupon rate to discount the value back to Time 1. The value of Bond Z at the upper node should be even valued at $949.98 (accept the 3rd decimal place).【Bond Z Value at upper node = ($981.64 + $918.48) / 2 * e^{-0.016487} = $949.98】\n\nTherefore, the answer is $949.98."

            "\n\nA forward contract is an agreement to transact an asset at a future point in time at a previously agreed price.\n\nLet’s say the asset is currently worth $1,000 and will be worth $1,050 in 6 months. By definition of a forward contract, someone is willing to pay $1,050 now for receiving $1,000 in 6 months, while another party is willing to receive $1,050 now for delivering $1,000 in 6 months.\n\nNo one is going to enter this contract unless they have an expectation that in 6 month $1,000 will be worth more than $1,050. There are basically two reasons why someone would want to enter this contract. First, the person receiving $1,050 now could reinvest the money for 6 months and get more than $1,050 in assets. Let’s assume the person can earn 10% annually on the investment. The person would be willing to enter the agreement because (1 + 0.1)^6  = 1.164 > 1.05.\n\nSecond, the person might think that in 6 months $1,000 will be worth less than $1,050, due to a general expectation that the market will go down. In that case, the person would like to lock in the selling price of $1,050.\n\nIn summary, the number of contract is inversely proportional to the price of the asset, and is directly related to how much the asset is expected to increase or decrease in price.\n\nIn this example, there is only one contract, so it must be that the owner expects the price of the asset to decrease by 6% in 6 months, because 6 / (1 + 0.1) = 0.06. Thus, if the asset increases in value by 10%, as expected by the owner originally, its price is expected to go down by 6% in 6 months. The asset is expected to perform worse than the market in general, otherwise the owner would have invested in the market in the first place.\n\nTherefore, the delta for a long forward contract is −0.06, meaning that an increase in the price of the underlying by 1%, will lead to a decrease in the value of the contract by 0.06 * 1 = -0.06."

The ratio needs to exclude the taxes related to the CFO and the interest related to the CFF. To adjust, we use the fact that net cash flow from financing is equal to cash paid for interest + issuance of new debt – repayments of debt. Similarly, net cash flow from investing activities is equal to capital expenditures – proceeds from sale of investments. The cash flow from financing for 2018 involves cash paid for interest of 1260 and cash received from issuance of new debt of 400.

Based on the two conditions you set, the question asks what will be the forward rate if I want to exchange 2 years in 2 years from now.  Basically we want to know how much it would cost us to change our 2 year forward contract in the future. We need to do something that we are familiar with, which is discounting. By definition, the forward rate is the rate which discounts the future value to the present. What's the future value? It's the number we want to exchange, which is 2 years. How would we find the present value of it? We discount it at the spot rate of 4 years which is 5%. 5% is the rate which discounts the future value of 4 years to the present. By the same token, we can find the present value of 2 years discounted at the spot rate of 3.7% which is 3.7%. If 3.7% discounting gives us 3.7 and 5% discounting gives us 5, then 4% which is midway between 3.7% and 5% will give us 4.

In the question, Bearing has a 2% management fee.\n\nIncentive fee is a percentage of the profits generated by the fund and is paid to the fund manager as an additional reward for generating positive returns. The formula to calculate the incentive fee is: Incentive fee = [(Profit – Hurdle rate) x Incentive fee rate]/ Fund value at the beginning of the year.

If the fund's annualized return is above the hurdle rate, the fund manager can keep the carried interest amount; otherwise, they have to refund the carried-interest amounts for the previous years. The carried interest rate is usually between 15% to 25%. In the question, Bearing has a 5% soft hurdle rate.\n\nHigh water mark is the highest historical value of the fund and used to determine when the fund manager can start to collect carried interest.

            "   \nFirst, we will have a look at the definition of a bond futures contract. Bond futures contracts are agreements to buy a specific bond at a set future date at a set price (Duccori, 2019).\nAnd it's also mentioned in the definition that the bond futures contract price is determined by taking the current price of the underlying bond, adding accrued interest to the last coupon payment date, subtracting accrued interest at futures contract expiration, and dividing the result by a conversion factor (Duccori, 2019).\nThen, in the problem, we are computing accrued interest at contract expiration. Accrued interest at contract expiration can be determined by subtracting accrued interest since the last coupon payment date from the accrued interest at the futures contract expiration.\nHere the bond futures expires in three months, so the accrued interest since the last coupon payment date is (0.30 / 4) * 3 = 0.075. The accrued interest at futures contract expiration is 0.20. Then accrued interest at contract expiration is 0.20 - 0.075 = 0.15.\nThus, according to the definition, the bond futures price should be 125 / 0.9 * 1.08 - 0.15 = $117. So, arbitrageurs would buy the bond futures contract at $117 and sell it at $125, resulting in an arbitrage profit of $125 - 117 = $8.\nTherefore, the answer is 8."

            " First, according to Panel A in Exhibit 2, the one-year forward LIBOR rate will decrease from 7.0037% to 5.7342% with a probability of 0.7 or from 7.0037% to 4.6947% with a probability of 0.3, based on the 10% volatility assumption. The same can be derived for Panel B.\n\nLet's take an example. When the one-year forward LIBOR rate is 5.7342%, the value of a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond would be $100.660 because the 5.25% coupon is greater than the 5.7342% forward LIBOR rate. When the one-year forward LIBOR rate is 4.6947%, the value of a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond would be $100.210 because the 5.25% coupon is greater than the 4.6947% forward LIBOR rate.\n\nWhen the forward LIBOR one-year rate is 5.7342%, the present value of the cash flows from a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond will be $99.660. When the forward LIBOR one-year rate is 4.6947%, the present value of the cash flows from a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond will be $99.21.\n\nTherefore, the stock-bond ratio at that time is 98.21/99.660 = 0.9821/1.0060 = 96.8, suggesting that investors require a 6.8% risk premium to hold the Ayrault, Inc. bonds. We can calculate the risk premium in another way. Using the 0.7/0.3 split probability for the interest rate, if the one-year forward LIBOR rate decreases to 5.7342%, the value of a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond would be $100.660. Using the same probability split for the interest rate, if the one-year forward LIBOR rate increases to 5.8605%, the value of a $100 par, 5.25%, one-year callable bond would be $99.935. Therefore, the risk premium is 99.935/100.660 - 1 = 8.075%, which is close to the previous calculation of 6.8%.\n\nThe value of the up-and"

The equation is:\n\nNI = D / (r – g)\n\nNI is the stock’s inherent worth, D is the net dividend stream to the stock, r is the required return and g is the growth rate.\n\nSince NY’s growth rate is steadily decreasing from 12% to 6% in five years, the average growth rate is (12% + 6%) / 2 = 8%. We can also calculate the intrinsic value based on the growth rate in each year and find the present value of the intrinsic value in each year using a 9% rate. Then we sum up all the present values. However, lurking behind this solution is the assumption that the company’s growth rate will remain the same for years after year five. To account for the company’s unsustainable growth rate, we can assign a growth rate of 6% to all the years after year five.\n\nUsing an 8% growth rate for five years, the intrinsic value of NY is: NI = (0.25 * 5) / (0.09 – 0.08) = $3.13.\n\nWith a 6% growth rate for ten years, the intrinsic value of NY is: NI = (0.25 * 10) / (0.09 – 0.06) = $5.26.\n\nNY’s intrinsic value ranges from $3.13 to $5.26 depending on the growth rate after year five. However, since Marie is a skillful portfolio manager, she should weigh the probability of each scenario and use the weighted average to calculate the stock’s inherent worth. For example, she can determine that the probability of NY maintaining a 12% growth rate is 10% (which is low) and the probability of it maintaining a 6% growth rate is 90% (which is high). She can then calculate the inherent worth to be (0.10 * $3.13) + (0.90 * $5.26) = $4.52. Therefore, the answer is $4.52."

If ABC sells more products, let's say an additional 10%, it means it needs more working capital, let's pick an arbitrary number, 20%. So, ABC needs to borrow the additional 20% of the increase in sales to satisfy the additional working capital requirement. Assuming the interest coverage remains the same because the increase in sales is the same size as interest expense, the net income will increase by 16% + 20% = 36%. Financial leverage is defined as the percent increase in net income divided by the percent increase in EBIT, so the DFL is (16% / 16%) * 100 = 1. We now need to figure out how much total leverage increased net income by. We know that (1) financial leverage increased net income by 36%, and (2) total leverage is just financial leverage plus degrees of working capital leverage, which we will arbitrarily pick as (20% / 20%) * 100 = 1. So, total leverage increased net income by 36% + 1 * 100 = 37%, so the DTL is (37% / 37%) * 100 = 1.5."

Assume the yield to maturity is 6%, so the bond will pay $100 / 0.06 which results to $1667.\nThen we need to take the number of payment periods into account. Here the bond has 2 payment periods per year, so that leaves 1 year / 2 which is 0.5 years to maturity. Now we just divide the time until maturity into the number of payment periods, so we have to multiply $1667 by 0.5 which results to $833. This is what the bond will pay at the next payment date, so we need to discount that for one period to find the price of the bond. Now we take the interest rate of 6% and divide it by 2 because we have two payment periods per year, so this results in 3%. Now we can use the formula: $833 * exp (-0.03) = $830.47\nThat is the price of the bond if the yield to maturity is 6%. Following the same steps with the other two bond, if the yield is 4.5%, then the price of the 6 month bond should be $101.47 * exp (-0.045) = $101.08; if the yield is 7%, then the price of the 2 year bond should be $100.32 * exp (-0.07) = $97.89.\nNow we have to calculate the present value of the future payments, so we take the smaller of each bond's price and its yield to maturity (yield to worst), which is 4.5%. Now we can use the same method as above to find the present value. The 6 month bond will pay $833 after half a year, so we have to multiple that by 2 because we have two payment periods per year, so that results in $1666. Now we have to subtract one period, so we have 0.5 years left until maturity, so we divide $1666 by 0.5 to find $3333. That is the bond's payment at maturity, so we need to divide that by the annual interest rate of 4.5% which is 9, so $3333 / 9 = $375.\nNow we calculate the present value of the future bond payments in the same way for the 1 and 2 year bond.

Therefore, the return objective is 5.5% + 3.5% = 9.0%. \nNow, let's find out how much we expect the portfolio to grow in one year. The expected return is the growth rate of the portfolio. The expected return is 9.0% and if we invest $100 now, at the end of the year the expected amount will be $100 * 1.090 = $110. In order to exceed the annual distribution, we want the amount to grow more than the distribution, which is $110 - $100 > $100 - $100 * 0.055 = $100 - $5.5. That means we need the expected return to be higher than 5.5%. So 9.0% > 5.5% which gives us 9.0% - 5.5% = 3.5%. However, we have to consider the risk-free rate. For the investment to be viable, we have to compensate for the risk by earning more than the risk-free rate. That means, 3.5% > 4.0% which gives us 3.5% - 4.0% = -0.5% . In other words, we expect to earn a positive expected return of 3.5% - 0.5% = 3.0%. \nBased on the information provided, we calculate the expected return as follows: \nExpected return = (Distribution rate) * (Risk premium)\nTherefore, the answer is 3."

It's quite obvious that Surge business holds all the assets for P-tech Corp, so let's first calculate Surge web business assets turnover (Annual revenue/average total assets). The average total asset over the last three years is 2,030, and the Surge web business revenue is 1,140. Surge web business total asset turnover is 1.8, which means that every year the total asset increases by an average of 1.8 times the yearly revenue. Given that P-tech will use the equity method for accounting, and we know that Surge's net income will be 500, and P-tech's operating income will be 300, which will add up to the 50% stake P-tech owns in the joint venture. Bravo's net income is 90, and we can estimate its operating income to be 50, given the net income. As Bravo owns the other 50% stake in the joint venture, the operating income will be 150. We also observe that joint venture revenue will be 980, which equals the total revenue of P-tech and Bravo. So, the total asset of Surge web business owned by the joint venture will be 800, given the operating income. We predict the total asset for Surge web business to be 1,040, which is 111% more than the total asset in the previous year, given the asset's turnover.\nTherefore, the answer is 1040"

If, after three months, the interest rate is 2.4%, which is lower than the rate expected initially, he needs to do something to increase the rate. To do this, Thompson sells the 97.00 interest rate futures contract, which means that he expects interest rates to fall in the future. This means he expects to pay less than the initial loan amount. Now let's see the overall picture. Firstly, Thompson gets a 3 month loan at 98.00. Then interest rates fall so Thompson sells a 97.00 interest rate futures contract. Finally, Thompson gets a 2.4% loan which he repays after three months and closes his 97.00 interest rate futures contract. We know that interest rate futures contracts have a 0.25% increment. So the difference between the two futures contracts is 0.25%, which means Thompson has to pay 0.25% more than the initial loan.

The expected return of each submarket, including government bond, equity, and income, must subtract the risk-free rate, which is the average government bond yield of 2.8%.\n\nStep 2: Then, we can calculate the expected return of equity. The average annual equity return of 4.6% needs to subtract the average government bond yield of 2.8%, which is 2.0%.\n\nStep 3: Then we need to calculate the historical CAPM alpha. The average annual real earnings growth of 6.0% needs to be subtracted by the average annual inflation rate of 2.3%, which is 3.7%.\n\nStep 4: Use the weighted average cost of capital to calculate the equity risk premium.

            " First of all, the REIT index's variance for the measurement duration is 16, which means REIT index has a standard deviation of √16 = 4. Then we need to think what \"publicly available REIT index\" here indicates. Generally a REIT is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. And since real estate investment often involves big money, its investment returns are widely tracking and analyzed. So the \"publicly available REIT index\" here refers to a REIT index fund, a fund that invests in a weighted average of stocks from multiple real estate investment trusts. REIT index funds provide diverse exposure to the real estate sector and allow investors to bypass the costs and complexities of direct real estate investment. Let's say David can use such a REIT index fund that tracks the total return of a basket of equities from listed real estate investment trusts. Through this REIT index fund, he can obtain the total return of a real estate investment and gauge the risk by using its standard deviation. Since it has a standard deviation of 4, let's say its σ = 4. David's calculation involves a present value of 1 σ for the multifamily properties investment, which means he estimates the uncertainty of the multifamily properties investment return at σ = 4 * 1.5 = 6. So the standard deviation of multifamily properties investment return for the investment duration is σ = 6 - 0.8 * 16 = 6 - 8 = 2.6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.6."

            "\n\nStep 1: The vega of a variance swap is the sensitivity of the swap to the realized volatility. Thus, it is equal to the annual volatility strike / realized volatility. In our case: 50,000 / (2 x 16) = 25,000.\n\nStep 2: The fair strike of a variance swap represents the annualized volatility expected for the period that the swap is contracted. Therefore. a six month variance swap on the S&P 500 that pays out in 6 months and is based on the volatility of the S&P 500 will have the volatility of the S&P 500 annualized over 6 months as its fair strike. Thus: 19% * (6 / 12) = 19 / 2 = 9.5%.\n\nStep 3: The notional of the variance swap is the vega traded. Hence, the value of the sold variance swap half a year later is equal to the notional * fair strike * time to expiry. In our case: 25,000 * 9.5% * 0.5 = 12,875.\n\nTo go further, as the interest rate is compounded annually, and half a year has gone by, the present value of the sold variance swap will be equal to the value at maturity * exp(- rt / 2) where r is the interest rate. The present value of the variance swap sold is thus: 12,875 * exp(- 0.025 / 2) = 12,218.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12,218."

Notional principal of bond 2: $10million * (100% - 50%) = $5 million.\n\nHence, we get a equation: $6M + $5M + $5M = $16million     -->     M = $16million / ($6million + $5million + $5million)  =  $16million / $21million            =  0.742.\n\nTherefore, the value of CDS held by XYZ is $5million notional principal * 0.0742 recovery rate = $0.359 million."

Also we know that the fixed payment that needs to be paid in 12 months is $100m * 0.9746 = $97.46m so the current value of the swap is the notional ($100m face value) minus the present value of the future fixed payments ($97.46m) which is equivalent to $100m - $97.46m = $2.54m. Also we know that the next fixed payment in 9 months will be for $98.2m notional so it will be $98.2m * 3% = $2.94m.\nBecause we are using the 0.5 year factor the present value of the next fixed payment is $2.54m / 0.978214 = $2.69m. If we subtract this from the current value we get $2.54m - $2.69m = -$0.15m.

So, the amount of money received from clients in the year 2012 was 95,000.\nLet's now focus on the balance sheet. The total current assets were 47,000 in the year 2012 and increased by 12,122 in 2013. So let's split these current assets in the proportion of 2/3 for accounts receivable and 1/3 for inventories. The accounts receivable were therefore 25,000 in 2012 and increased by 11,122 in 2013. Let's now split this accounts receivable in the proportion of 2/3 for the amount due from customers in 2013 and 1/3 for the amount due from customers in 2012. The amount due from customers in 2013 was therefore 16,388. This represents 2/3 * 25,000 = 16,388 of the total amount due from customers. We can now deduce that the amount due from customers in 2012 was therefore 25,000 - 16,388 = 8,612. The total amount due from customers in 2013 was 16,388 + 8,612 = 25,000. We can now deduce that the inventories were 13,000 in 2012 and increased by 11,122 in 2013. Let's now split this inventories in the proportion of 2/3 for the inventory related to the amount due from customers in 2013 and 1/3 for the inventory related to the amount due from customers in 2012. The inventory related to the amount due from customers in 2013 was therefore 7,014. This represents 2/3 * 13,000 = 7014 of the total inventory. We can now deduce that the inventory related to the amount due from customers in 2012 was therefore 13,000 - 7,014 = 5,986. We can now easily deduce that the cash and investments were 21,122 in 2013 and 25,000 in 2012. Everything together, the amount of money received from clients in the year 2013 was 95,000 - 4,500 - 3,500 = 90,500. And the amount of money received from clients in the year 2012 was 100,000 - 4,500 - 3,500 = 96,000. The difference of both years is 90,500 - 96,000 = -5,500."

Secondly, interest burden takes 0.8 * $300 = $240 of the pre - tax income. So the pre - operating income is $300 - $240 = $60. Thirdly, current ratio is 1.5, which means for every $1 of current asset, $1.5 of current liability is needed to support. The current asset is 1.5 * $1 = $1.5 times of the current liability. Let the current asset be $1 and current liability be $0.5 for simplicity, then the quick asset ($1 + $1.5) should be 1.5 times of the quick liability ($0.5). So the quick asset turnover is $2 / $1 = 2 times. Therefore, the quick ratio is 2. Fourthly, the leverage ratio is calculated as net interest bearing debt / EBIT. Let the net interest bearing debt be $100 and the EBIT be $60, then the leverage ratio is $100 / $60 = 1.6. Finally, EBIT margin is 20%, so EBIT is 20% * $1000 = $200. Let's put all the pieces together. The total asset turnover is 3 * 2 = 6. The ROE before extraordinary items and income taxes is (6 - 2) * 20% = 40%.

            " We need to find out how many shares Apoth will move if the FDA review concludes positive. So we calculate the distance from strike price to exercise price plus the volatility multiplied by the square root of the time to expiration in years. We do the same for a negative review result. Then we subtract the negative movement from the positive movement to find out the total movement. At last, we divide the total movement by the price movement per Apoth share to find out how many shares Apoth will move. We use the average of the two underlying movements because it is less risky than betting on one direction. After that, we divide the total number of Apoth share by the number of option contracts to find out how many contracts we need to hedge. Since it's a call option, we sell the contracts instead of buying.\nPositive movement:\n(Exercise price - Strike price) + (volatility * sqrt(time to expiration))\n=(46 - 38) + (0.56 * sqrt(0.5))\n=6 + 0.88 * 0.5\n=5.24\n\nNegative movement:\n(Strike price - Exercise price) + (volatility * sqrt(time to expiration))\n=(36 - 38) + (0.64 * sqrt(0.5))\n=-2 + 1.28 * 0.5\n=-1.84\n\nTotal underlying movement:\n5.24 - -1.84\n=3.4\n\nNumber of shares to move:\n3.4 / (38 - 36) =133,333 / 2 = 66,666\n\nNumber of option contracts:\n66,666 / 100 = 666\n\nTherefore, the answer is 666"

            " We can ignore the CDS portion of the basis trade for now because the question is about the bond portion of the trade. If we buy a 5-year corporate bond labeled Bond E that is presently yielding a return of 7.5%, we commit to pay the face value of the bond at maturity, which is in 5 years. We can look at the return as the present value of the money we commit to pay in 5 years subtracted from the price we pay today. Through compounding, the money we commit to pay in 5 years will be worth more than 7.5% of the face value of the bond, so the price we pay today for the bond is less than its present value.\nNow, suppose in the future the credit risk of bond E improves so the credit spread narrows to 2%. In that case, the return of bond E rises to 5.5% (7.5% - 2%) because now we commit to pay less than 7.5% of the face value of the bond in 5 years. If the credit risk of bond E further improves, the return of bond E could rise to 5.5% + 2% = 7.5%. In that case, the price of bond E will rise to its present value because we commit to pay exactly 7.5% of the face value of the bond in 5 years. It follows that when the return of bond E reaches 7.5%, its price will stop rising and begin to fall as investors require a higher yield to compensate for the risk of bonds with higher yields. Therefore, Thompson should wait until the return of bond E rises to 7.5% and then sell the bond to reap the accrued profit from the basis trade. The accrued profit is the difference between the price Thompson buys and the price Thompson sells the bond, which is the price oscillation range of 7.5% - 5.5% = 2%. In percentage to the face value of the bond, the accrued profit is 2% / 7.5% = 0.4, or 24% of the face value of the bond."

The computation is P = $100 * $1/(1+0.02*2) = $95.45.\n\nFrom the price, we can easily calculate the accrued interest for every 100 of par value as the difference between the par value and price: $100 - $95.45 = $4.55.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4.55."

Hence on 10 April 2014 only one year's interest had accrued, and on 10 October 2014 two years' interest would have accrued.\nThird, using the day count convention, we can find the number of days between the Interest Payment Dates easily. For example, there are 180 days between 10 April and 10 October using the 30/360 day count.\nFourth, using the day count convention again, we can add up the number of days between the Interest Payment Dates and the Maturity Date easily. For example, there are 432 days between 10 April 2014 and 10 October 2016 using the 30/360 day count. At this point, we can easily back out the number of days between 10 April 2014 and 10 October 2014, and that would be 360 days.\nFinally, we can calculate how much interest should have accrued on 10 April 2014 using the Annual Coupon of 5% and 360 days, and that would be a semi-annual payment of 100 * 5 / 2 = 50. Therefore, the price of this bond on 10 April 2014 should be 100 - 50 = 50. Similarly, the price of this bond on 10 October 2014 should be 50 - 25 = 25.\nTherefore, the flat price for Bond H, scheduled for sale on the settlement date of 16 June 2014 is 25."

Given the marginal tax rate of 40%, the corporation is subject to a $40 tax cost incurred for each $100 of prefered stock issued. Therefore, the after-tax cost of issuing preferred stock is equal to $100 par / (1 - 0.40) = $100 * 0.6 = $60 per share issued.

We use the beginning assets of year 1 as the high-water mark, and the fund has not earned any incentive fee since the beginning assets of year 1 ($98) is smaller than the ending assets of year 1 ($112) or year 3 ($132). Thus the incentive fee earned is $26.4. In summary, the total return including management fee and incentive fee is $16 + $26.4 = $42.4. The net-of-fees return is $42.4 - $392 + $98 = $340.

They are the $25m shortage with a 15% likelihood, and the most favorable scenario with an $80m excess with a 10% likelihood.\nThen we determine how to split the scenarios into two dimensions. The two dimensions are the likelihood of the scenarios, and the amount of the scenarios. We can plot them on a two-dimensional coordinate, where X-axis is the likelihood from 0% to 100%, and Y-axis is the amount from negative to positive. Then we plot the two scenarios as two points on the twodimensional plots.\nThen we need to think about the most likely scenario. In the question, it mentions that the most likely scenario is a $15m excess with a 75% likelihood. We plot a point at the likelihood of 75% and the amount of $15m on the two-dimensional plots. Since we already have two points, we can connect those two points with a line. The line is the overall trend of the two scenarios.\nThen we need to think about the anticipated liquidity. We start from the origin o, and draw a perpendicular to the X-axis, and intercept theline with the perpendicular. The intercept point is the anticipated liquidity given the two scenarios.\nFinally, we output the intercept point as the anticipated liquidity.

We know that the present value of the FRN at issuance is 95.76, thus, the value of the FRN at maturity should be equal to the par value (100).\nLet's denote N as the number of years.

Using a binomial model to price an asset in 2 years with a risk-free rate is 1% annually, the expected return of the asset in the first year is 4.48% (determining this value is left for the reader). Let's assume the volatility of the asset is 20%.\nWe have to find the value today of a 1-year call option on the bond valued at 950 or 970 in 2 years. We will now use the Black-Scholes-Merton model.\n\nStep 2. We have S0=950 (the bond's value in 2 years if interest rates don't change), σ=20% (volatility is 20%), T=2 years (time to maturity), r=1% (risk-free rate), K=960 (striking price).\nNow, let's find  N(d1). d1=2*σ*sqrt(T)=2*20%*sqrt(2)=40% (determining this value is left for the reader).\n\nStep 3. Now we can find the present value of the 1-year call option on this bond as follows: PV=S0*N(d1)*Phigh-S0*N(-d1)*Plow. Where Phigh and Plow are the risk-neutral probabilities.\n\nStep 4. Now we need to find Phigh and Plow.\nPlow=N(-d1)/N(d1)=N(40%)/N(-40%). We already know N(40%) from step 2 so now we need to find N(-40%).\nN(-d)=N(d)*(2-exp(-rd\"))=0.6369*0.6=0.3834 (determining this value value is left for the reader).\n\nStep 5. Now we can find the answer: 950*0.3834*0.6369-970*0.6371*0.3835=146.14 dollars therefore the answer is 146.14."

Moreover, $P_{1,2}$ = $P_{2,2}$ * 0.8479, and $P_{1,3}$ = $P_{2,3}$ * 0.8479, which suggests $P_{2,2}$ = $P_{1,2}$ * 1.1022 and $P_{2,3}$ = $P_{1,3}$ * 1.1022.

            " First of all, since interest is compounded monthly which means it is calculated monthly and added to the principal, we can find the interest rate per month by dividing the annual interest rate with the number of months per year (assuming 12 months per year):6%/12 months/year = 0.5%.\nWe can split the transaction into six payments of £33,333.33, with each payment consisting of principal and interest.\nAssuming that the principal + interest payment is paid every 12 months, the principal of the first payment can be calculated as: 200000 - 66667 = 133333.33. To calculate the interest payment of the first month, we can use the formula:InterestPayment = Principal * InterestRate, where InterestPayment is the interest paid in that month, Principal is the principal left after the payment and InterestRate is the interest rate per year divided by the number of times interest is compounded in a year (hence in this case it's the interest rate per month):InterestPayment = 133333.33 * 0.005 = 666.666. To calculate the principal owed the next month, we can use the formula:NewPrincipal = Principal - InterestPayment, where NewPrincipal is the remaining principal after the payment is made:133333.33 - 666.666 = 133333.37. We can keep doing the same for the next 5 years and we can quickly notice that the principal increases by a very small amount each year (approximately £0.37), which means the interest payment dominates the payment and the interest payment is pretty much the same every year.\nLet's assume the interest payment is £666.67 every month.\nThe total payment due every month is £666.67 + £33,333.33 = £35,000.\nTherefore, the answer is 35000."

The final step is to calculate the P/B multiple. For this, we will use this formula: P/B = (RI / k) / (r - g) = (0.0036 / 3) / (0.12 - 0.045) = 0.0036 / 0.0067 = 5.2 . The final answer is 5.2."

Now let's calculate the average collection period. The total sales during the year is $300mil + $390mil = $690mil. If the average collection period is 15 days, then the total number of days that Farrow needs to collect money is $690mil / 15 day / year / 365 days = 48 years! That's absurd, obviously the total sales cannot be collected in such a long time. So something must be wrong with our calculation here.\n\nNow let's re-calculate. The total sales during the year is $300mil + $390mil = $690mil. If the average collection period is 19 days, then the total number of days that Farrow needs to collect money is $690mil / 19 day / year / 365 days = 12 years. It's a different story if Farrow needs to collect money for 12 years. Now let's think about how to decrease the collection period from 19 days to 15 days. We know that $90mil sales will be added in the next year, so the total increment of sales is $90mil + $300mil = $390mil. If Farrow wants to decrease the collection period from 19 days to 15 days, then it needs to decrease the average accounts receivable balance from $300mil to $315mil, assuming the sales will be collected evenly through the year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $315mil."

This means that there is a 75% chance that a randomly selected non-subprime mortgage is not in negative equity. Also, because all the subprime mortgages are in negative equity, we know that every subprime mortgage has a principal balance higher than the value of the collateral.

Typically, in a currency swap, the notional principal is exchanged upfront and there is no further principal exchange during the tenor of the contract. The only cash flows during the tenor of the contract are the fixed coupon payments.

            " The labor force grows 1.9% which indicates more people will join the laborer's group and # of laborers will increment by the growth rate. So the average GDP per capita will grow at 1.9% as the size of the pie increases. Similarly, labors' productivity will also impact the per-capita GDP size with a 1.4% growth rate. Usually, the more productive a labor force is, the more productive output will be. We have 235m people working in the US as of Aug 2022, so the increment of productivity (1.4%) prompts the GDP size to increase by 1.4*235m or $320b at the annual level. Consumer spending and investment also affect the U.S. GDP. The growth rates of 3.1% for consumer spending and 3.1% for investment accordingly translate to a $900b increment for the U.S. GDP on an annual basis. The government deficit also impacts the total GDP by -0.5%. When the government prints money to cover the deficit (which is an expense), it has the equivalent economic effect as destroying that much money. The last one is TFP. TFP measures the total output of goods and services that is not accounted for by the direct inputs of labor and capital. Currently, it grows by 0.5% annually. The total factor productivity output is captured in the national accounts as net exports and it shrunk by 0.5% so its impact will be -0.5*$1.2T (U.S. net exports in 2022) or -$60b at the annual level. So let us put everything together to make the bottom-up calculation. The sum of all the increments is $320b+$900b-$60b+$0T ($0 for gov deficit). The total is $1.2T annual increment in GDP prompted by all the factors. If the GDP is $21T now (2022 level), a $1.2T increment will prompt a 5.7% growth rate assuming the baseline is $21T.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.7%."

            " We can use the following PV=FV/(1+r)ergic expression to calculate the present value of a financial asset with a 'r' interest rate. The bond's present value should be equal to its par value 100 if the interest rate 'r' is equal to its coupon rate 7%. This expression is valid only if the interest rate 'r' is smaller than the bond's coupon rate 7%. In our case, the opposite is true as the current 1-year spot rate is lower than the bond's coupon rate. Actually in this situation, a rational investor would not buy this bond since she could get a higher return investing in a 1-year bond and rolling-over the money every year. If the bond is not sold to a rational investor, it is possible to mint a new 2-year bond using this existing bond, with the financial market, in order to benefit from the coupon rate which is higher than the current market interest rate. This operation, called 'strip', consists of extracting a zero-coupon bond from a cash flow bond. Depending on how the strip is done, there are 2 types of zero-coupon bonds that can be extracted. If the 2 existing coupons of the bond are kept after the strip, we will have a 2-year zero-coupon bond. The strip is also used to calculate the present value of the zero-coupon bond, let's assume it has a 'z' interest rate. The 2-year zero-coupon bond will be worth . In order to determine the number 'a', it is necessary to determine a discount factor for each year. The PV=FV/(1+r)ergic formula works for a number 'r' that is lower or equal to 'a'. So the interest rate for the first year can go up to 2 and for the second year it can go up to 3. The following expression can be used to determine a discount factor: At this step we can convert the previous expression into a simpler form by taking the square root of both members, it provides: Thus, .\nFinally, a is greater or equal to 4, thus the 2-year zero coupon bond should be worth at least which is above the par value of 100. The bond's value would be probably rounded-up to 110 in practice (which represents a 10% ROI), so 'Therefore, the answer is 110'."

In the exhibit we can see that the 3-month put option with $30 strike price has a cost of $5.2. What if we want to buy a protective put for a position of 100 shares? The cost would be 500% higher, so: 100 shares * $30.50 value / share = $3050 total value / position * 500% = $1525 cost / position. So far so good, now we need to see how much cheaper is to buy a put instead of selling a call (which is the same as buying a put). That's because puts and calls have opposite behaviour. If you are buying protection with a put, you are saying that you think the stock will not go down (and therefore up), so someone that's selling protection with a call would expect the opposite so the stock would go up! That would mean that the call contract would be much more expensive because calls become more valuable as the underlying security goes up. So the difference between the cost of a put and a call would tell you how much more expensive is the call. In the example that means: $1525 cost of the put - $12.42 cost of the call = $2.83. However the client only wants to spend $500 max in that protection, meaning that we need to find a cheaper alternative. As we are looking for a put, we would need to take a look at the put options in the table, and from that, the closest one to $2.83 is the 3-month put with $25 strike price for which we can see that the cost is $2.78. That would be the optimum strategy. If you use it the math would be: $3050 total value / position * 100% - $2.78 cost / position of the put option = $2800 max that the client can spend in a call option. So the answer is $2800."

By definition, the Macaulay duration of bond B is equal to the present value of the cashflows of the 7-year bond, divided by the difference between the 7-year bond’s yield-to-maturity and the bond’s yield-to-maturity. The present value of the 7-year bond is equal to its price tag, times its par value. The price tag of the 7-year bond is equal to the present value of its cashflows, divided by its par value. The yield-to-maturity of the 7-year bond can be calculated as the average of the coupon rate and the maturity rate. Let’s denote the par value of the 7-year bond as N, its coupon rate as c, its yield-to-maturity as y, and the price tag of the 7-year bond as P. Then, y = 0.5 * (c + N * y) implies that N * y = 0.5 * c - 0.5 * N * y. By solving this equation for y, one finds that y = 0.1 * c. So the 7-year bond yields 0.1 * 4% = 4% more than the 3-year bond.

That means that the aggregated valuation of the minority shareholding is worth 85% of the control value. Let's say that the control value is CV. Then the minority shareholding is worth 0.85 * CV. The deduction due to the absence of marketability means that the aggregated valuation of the minority shareholding, when marketed, would only fetch 75% of its calculated aggregated valuation. So the marketed minority shareholding is worth 0.75 of its aggregated valuation when not marketed. Let's say the aggregated valuation when not marketed is AVnm. Then, the marketed minority shareholding is worth 0.75 * AVnm. The total discount is the difference between the marketed and not marketed aggregated valuation, which is: 0.75 * AVnm - 0.85 * CV = 0.1 * AVnm = 0.1 * (0.75 * AVnm)"

            " First of all, the value of the firm increased during the year by $642 million - $583.1 million = $59 million, net of management fee. That means the net amount of assets under management increased by $59 million, so the annual management fee was at least 2% * $59 million = $1.18 million. Let's make an assumption that the annual management fee was exactly at that value. That means the net investment result before fees was at $642 million - $1.18 management fee = $640.82 million. We know that the initial AUM was $583.1 million and the hurdle rate is 4%, so the firm collected incentive fees if the net investment result was higher than $583.1 million + 4% * $583.1 million = $610 million. In our case, the net investment result was $640.82 million, so the incentive fees were calculated as follows: 20% * ($642 million - $610 million) = $48.4 million. That means the total fees were at least at $1.18 million + $48.4 million = $60.6 million. If we deduct these fees from the value of the firm before the fee calculation ($642 million), we'll get the net value for the investor $642 million - $60.6 million = $580.4 million. And the net return for the investor for the year would be at $580.4 million / $583.1 million = 98.54%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 98.54%."

So let's multiplySize(in millions) with 1000 to getSizem (in thousands).With a one-unit change inSizem the ROE will change by (taking the fund’scumulative data as a basis):\nα1 *Size* 1000 = α1 * 1000 *Sizem = 23m / year.\nThe difference inSizebetween stocks X and Y is 200m – 100m = 100m (in thousands), so the difference in ROE projection is：\n100m / year / 2 = 50 percentage points.\nHowever, stock Y actually has a lower ROE than stock X. So the model is wrong which means thatα2 is incorrect. The question does not say anything about the direction of the correlation between D/E and ROE. If the average ROE of fund stocks with a D / E of 8 was 10%, a D / E of 12 could well have had an ROE of 8%, giving an incorrect negative correlation. To calculate the impact of leverage you need to forecast the ROE of Y with an empiric D / E of 8 and of X with a D / E of 12 and then subtract the results.\nWith an empiricD / Eof 8 the ROE of Y would beα0 +α1 * 100* 10 + α2 * 8 = 13%.\nWith aD / Eof 12 the ROE of X would beα0 + α1 * 200 * 12 + α2 * 12 = 28%.\nCollins therefore forecasts a difference of 28% - 13% = 15pp ROE for stockX versus stockY.

            "\n\nStep 1: First calculate the total interest payments provided by the bond throughout its life, starting from the purchase date. Since the bond pays a semiannual interest, the total number of interest payments is 7 * 2 = 14. Therefore, the total interest is 14 * 5 / 2 = $35.\n\nStep 2: Let the maturity value of the bond be B. Since an investor buys the bond at a price lower than its maturity value, we know that B - P = 35, where P is the price of the bond. By multiplying both sides of the equation by 100, since par value is 100, we know that B - P * 100 = 3500.\n\nStep 3: By using the present value of an annuity formula, we know that B / (1 + r)14 = P * 100, where r is the market discount rate of 3%. By substituting step 1 into step 3, we know B / 1.0314 = P * 100, therefore P = B / 1.0314 = $1900.37."

That means, the preferred shares can be treated as an interest rate synthetic instrument.

We'll use this information to find the value of z. If we use the right tail, we know that 99% of observations will fall in the interval μ - 3σ to μ, so 100% - 99% = 1% of observations will fall outside of μ - 3σ. Setting the equation to z/100, we get 1% = z, so z = 100. If we use the left tail, we know that 99% of the observations will fall in the intervalμ to μ + 3σ, so 100% - 99% = 1% of the observations will fall outside of μ + 3σ. Setting this equation to z/100, we get 1% = z, so z = 100.\nSince we know that z is equal to 100 both times, then we know that the 2.5% is the same amount on both tails, so it must lie within the interval μ - 3σ to μ + 3σ. However, we know that the percentage of observations outside of the range is equal to z/100, and the percentage of observations in the range is 1 - z/100, so a total of 2.5% on both sides means that the right side has to have 1.25% and the left side also has to have 1.25%. That means that while the right side will have z = 100 * 1.25 = 125 observations, the left side will also have z = 100 * 1.25 = 125 observations. So we have 325 total obsevervations that lie inside of the range and have standard deviation σ.\nWe know that 99% of the observations for revenue must also lie in this range, which is 33% larger, and since 99% is roughly half of all the observations, we can double the number of observations to 650. Since there are 325 obsevervations in the interval as well, that means there are 325 + 325 = 650 - 325 = 325 observations outside of it.

Amortized cost is the measure for accounting purpose. For financial reporting purpose, the fair value should be used.

            "\n\nWe will have twelve yearly distribution. You can naively assume they are equal, then the average annual return rate is 8% / 12 = 0.67% / year. That means if we invest $50,000 today, after twelve years, we will get $50,000 * (1 + 0.67%)^12 = $54,065. Then each yearly distribution amount should be $54065 / 12 = $4531.67.\n\nHowever, the distribution is not equal, the earlier distribution will get a higher interest. We can use the formula : Future value = Present value * (1 + Interest rate) ^ years to calculate each distribution. The last distribution should be close to $4531.67, so we can use bisection search to find the first distribution. It takes log_2(54065) = 12.56 years, and the first distribution is $50,000 * (1 + 0.008)^(12.56) = $4528.46.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4528.46."

The gross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold which is $900,000 - $700,000 = $200,000. Next, let's look at the cash collected in 2009. It corresponds to the revenue of 2009 which is $1,000,000. We can see that all the sales were transformed in cash which is usually not the case. Let's assume that the other costs of $100,000 were also paid in cash. The change in cash during the year is $800,000 - $100,000 = $700,000. Let's compute the net income which is the difference between the gross profit and the change in cash which is $200,000 - $700,000 = $-500,000.

If they moved perfectly together, the correlation would be 1.0, and if they moved in opposite directions all the time, the correlation would be -1.0. So, we know that 72% of the time the WTI spot and futures prices will move in the same direction.\nThe annualized volatility of the WTI spot price is 0.35, meaning that on average, the spot price moves up or down 0.35 each day. We can annualize the Brent volatility by multiplying the daily volatility of 0.27 by the square root of the number of trading days in a year, which is roughly 254 days. The annualized volatility of the Brent futures price is 0.27 * √(254) = 0.28.\nNow, we need to calculate the average daily price change of the WTI spot price that will offset the price change of the Brent futures contract. The hedge ratio is the number of barrels of WTI needed to hedge 1 Brent futures contract. Since the annualized volatility of the WTI spot price is 0.35, twice that number, 0.7, is the average daily price change of the WTI spot price. A price change of 0.7 will offset the price change of the Brent contract, so the hedge ratio is 1 / 0.7 or 1.43.

Let's say the bond pays $150 coupon every year and the basis point change in yield is 25. This means current yield is 150/1000 * 25 = 3.75% (estimated, not exact; you don't need exact answer).\n\nLet's say the bond has a duration of 8, then a change of basis point in yield will lead to a change of 8 * 25 / 100 = 200% of the bond's price. Estimated 3.75% yield is currently 25 basis points higher than the coupon rate of the bond. If the bond has a 200% price sensitivity to yield, the bond will trade at a discount of (3.75% - 3%) / 200% = 1.875% if current yield is higher than the coupon rate. If the bond has a duration of 8, this means the bond will trade at par when the yield is (coupon rate + duration * (coupon rate - current yield)) / duration = (3% + 8 * (3% - 3.75%)) / 8 = 2.9375%.\n\nIf the bond has a 200% price sensitivity to yield, the bond will trade at a premium of (current yield - coupon rate) / 200% = 0.625% if current yield is below the coupon rate.

The bond price method evaluates the new price of a bond when the yield changes. The discount rate method reflects the interest rate used to discount future cash flows.\nTherefore, the key is to estimate the percent change of the yield. Since the given information is the basis points, we need to calculate the percent change first. Assume the current yield is Y, the new yield after the shift is Y+ΔY. We have Y+(ΔY/100)*Y= Y+ΔY. Then we can solve the percent change: ΔY/Y= (ΔY/100)*100%. If the yield changes to 6.95%, then the percent change is (0.025/6.7)*100%=3.85%.\n\nThen we can apply the 2 methods to estimate the value change of Michael's portfolio:\n\nUsing the bond price method:\n\nThe price of a bond will fall if the yield rises because new bonds would provide a higher yield, so existing bonds would have to fall in price to keep investors in the bond from incurring a loss. In this example, the duration of Michael's bond position is 6.44 so if we assume a parallel shift to the yield curve where all maturity ranges move by the same amount, the bond position will fall in value by approximately 6.44*3.85%=USD 245,200.\n\nUsing the discount rate method:\n\nWhen calculating the present value of future cash flows using a discount rate, any change in the discount rate will result in a proportional change in the present value. If Michael's bond position had a present value of USD 70m using a 6.7% discount rate, a 3.85% increase in the discount rate will result in a present value that is 3.85/100*70=USD 245,200 lower.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 245200"

Since modified duration measures only the straight-line portion of a bond's price decline, we also need to consider the impact of convexity. Convexity measures the “curviness” of a bond's price-yield relationship and represents the additional price decline as a result of the non-linear price-yield relationship. Convexity of 58.32 indicates that in addition to the price decline of 0.4% resulting from modified duration, the bond's price is expected to decline by approximately 58.32 / 100 * 0.4% = 0.23%. Combining these two price effects, we determine that the bond's price is expected to decline by 0.4% + 0.23% = 0.53% as a result of a 20bps rise in yield-to-maturity.\nTherefore, the answer is 0.53%."

The variance of the portfolio is 420 (=30*15+70*12) as the security weight of the first asset is 30% and that of the second asset is 70%. The covariance is 144 (=420-300-168) as the total variance is 420 and the variance of each asset is 300 and 168."

Then, since the tax rate is 40%, the total tax burden will be $4,166 x 40% = $1,655. Consequently, the sixth year's pretax income will be $4,166 - $1,655 = $2,511.\nTherefore, the answer is $2,511."
