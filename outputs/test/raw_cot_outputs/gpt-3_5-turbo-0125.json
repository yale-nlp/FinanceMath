        "question": "Firms A and B start the year with the same book value of equity and identical tax rates. They have the same transactions all year and report them in the same way, except for one. Both firms purchase a printer worth £300,000 with a lifespan of three years and a salvage value of £0 at the start of the year. Firm A capitalizes the printer and depreciates it using a straight-line method, while Firm B expenses the printer. The following information is collected for Firm A at the end of the year. Given this information, what would be Firm B's return on equity using year-end equity?",
        "output": [
            "1. Calculate depreciation expense for Firm A using the straight-line method:\nDepreciation Expense = (Cost of printer - Salvage value) / Useful life\nDepreciation Expense = (£300,000 - £0) / 3 = £100,000\n\n2. Calculate the adjusted Net Income for Firm A after recognizing depreciation expense:\nAdjusted Net Income for Firm A = Net Income - Depreciation Expense\nAdjusted Net Income for Firm A = £750,000 - £100,000 = £650,000\n\n3. Calculate the ending shareholders' equity for Firm A:\nEnding Shareholders' Equity for Firm A = Ending shareholders' equity + Adjusted Net Income\nEnding Shareholders' Equity for Firm A = £10,000,000 + £650,000 = £10,650,000\n\n4. Calculate the return on equity for Firm A:\nReturn on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\nROE for Firm A = £750,000 / (£10,000,000 + £10,650,000) / 2 = £750,000 / £10,325,000 = 0.0728 or 7.28%\n\n5. Calculate the return on equity for Firm B using year-end equity:\nSince Firm B expenses the printer and does not capitalize or depreciate it, the Net Income and Shareholders' Equity for Firm B remains the same as Firm A:\nReturn on Equity (ROE) for Firm B = £750,000 / £10,000,000 = 0.075 or 7.50%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.50%."

        "question": "Sephora is a US-operated company that specializes in the sale of beauty products. It has a Canadian branch, Glossy Inc, that only carries out operations in Canada. It was established on 31 December 2015, and Glossy Inc uses the US dollar as its main currency. Let's consider that fixed assets were purchased at the company's conceptual stage. The financial statement details for the years ending 2015 and 2016 are provided in the adjacent table: Can you compute the converted value of Glossy Inc's retained earnings as of 31 December 2016?",
        "output": [
            "1. To compute the converted value of Glossy Inc's retained earnings as of 31 December 2016, we need to find the original amount of retained earnings in Canadian Dollars (C$) as of 31 December 2016.\n\n2. From the table, we see that the retained earnings in 2015 were C$21.\n\n3. We need to find the retained earnings for 2016. Retained earnings for 2016 can be calculated as:\n   Retained earnings 2016 = Retained earnings 2015 + (Net Income 2016 - Dividends 2016)\n\n4. Net Income 2016 and Dividends 2016 values are not given in the table. Without these values, we cannot compute the retained earnings for 2016 directly in Canadian Dollars.\n\n5. However, we can convert the retained earnings for 2016 into US Dollars by using the average exchange rate for 2016 (0.96). The formula to convert to US Dollars is:\n   Retained earnings 2016 (in US $) = Retained earnings 2016 (in C$) * Average exchange rate in 2016 (C$/US$)\n\n6. Once we find the retained earnings for 2016 in US Dollars, we can convert this value into Canadian Dollars using the exchange rate on 31 December 2016 (0.94) to get the equivalent amount in C$.\n\nTherefore, the answer lies in the calculation of Retained earnings 2016 in US Dollars."

        "question": "At the start of 2013, corporation X released 5-year bonds with a face value of $2,000,000. The market interest rate stands at 6%, and on each 31 December, a 5% coupon is paid on the bonds. What could be the calculated bonds payable at the time they were issued?",
        "output": [
            "1. The face value of the bonds is $2,000,000.\n\n2. The market interest rate is 6%, and the bonds pay a 5% coupon annually. This means that the coupon payment is 5% of the face value, which is $2,000,000 * 5% = $100,000 per year.\n\n3. To calculate the bonds payable at the time they were issued, we can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is: PV = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where PV is the present value, C is the annual coupon payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the total number of periods. In this case, n is 5 years.\n\n4. Plugging in the values, we get: PV = $100,000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.06)^-5) / 0.06].\n\n5. Calculating the present value of the annuity, we get: PV = $100,000 * [(1 - (1.06)^-5) / 0.06] = $100,000 * [(1 - 0.747258) / 0.06] = $100,000 * [0.252742 / 0.06] = $100,000 * 4.2123667 = $421,236.67.\n\nTherefore, the calculated bonds payable at the time they were issued is $421,236.67."

This results in 3*2*0.35 = 2.1.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the variance of the sum (3X+2Y) using the formula: Var(aX+bY) = a^2*Var(X) + b^2*Var(Y) + 2ab*Cov(X,Y). Substituting the values from Steps 1, 2, and 3: Var(3X+2Y) = 9 + 4 + 2*3*2*0.35 = 23.4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23.4."

        "question": "A customer, Alice Thompson, thinks that large-cap stock prices will witness a slight increase, and she wishes to benefit from this trend using a bull spread technique. Parker suggests that Thompson utilize 1/100 options of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJX) which will expire in two months. The current DJX price stands at $91. Exhibit 1 offers current information on two DJX call options which will expire within two months. Exhibit 1 DJX Call Options Expiring in Two Months Thompson decides to use 100 contracts for each position. Each contract equals 100 shares. At the DJX call options expiration, what is the maximum potential gain from the bull spread strategy suggested for Thompson?\n",
        "output": [
            "Step 1: Understand the bull spread strategy\n- A bull spread strategy involves buying a call option with a lower exercise price and selling a call option with a higher exercise price.\n- The maximum gain from a bull spread is achieved when the stock price is above the higher exercise price at expiration.\n\nStep 2: Determine the specific call options to be used in the bull spread using the provided table\n- For the bull spread, Alice will buy the 88 strike call option and sell the 94 strike call option.\n- Based on the table, the delta for the 88 strike call option is 0.75 and for the 94 strike call option is 0.30.\n\nStep 3: Calculation of the potential gain at expiration\n- Calculate the premium paid for buying the 88 strike call option: 100 contracts * 100 shares/contract * $4.40 premium = $44,000\n- Calculate the premium received for selling the 94 strike call option: 100 contracts * 100 shares/contract * $1.00 premium = $10,000\n- Therefore, the net premium paid/received at the beginning of the strategy is $44,000 - $10,000 = $34,000.\n\nStep 4: Determining the maximum potential gain at expiration\n- The maximum potential gain at expiration is achieved when the stock price is above the higher exercise price, which is 94 in this case.\n- Calculate the maximum gain per share: ($94 - $88) = $6\n- Calculate the maximum gain per contract: $6 * 100 shares/contract = $600\n- Calculate the total maximum gain for 100 contracts: $600 * 100 contracts = $60,000\n\nTherefore, the maximum potential gain from the bull spread strategy suggested for Thompson at DJX call options expiration is $60,000."

            "Step 1: First, we need to understand the concept of the break-even inflation rate. The break-even inflation rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate. It represents the level of inflation that would result in an investor breaking even on their investment.\n\nStep 2: The formula for break-even inflation rate is:\nBreak-even inflation rate = Nominal interest rate - Real interest rate\n\nStep 3: Given values:\nReal default-free interest rate = 4.5%\nAnticipated future inflation = 3.5%\nBreak-even inflation rate = 5%\n\nStep 4: Since we know the values of the real default-free interest rate and the anticipated future inflation rate, we can calculate the nominal interest rate using the break-even inflation rate formula:\nNominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Break-even inflation rate\n\nStep 5: Plugging in the values:\nNominal interest rate = 4.5% + 5% = 9.5%\n\nStep 6: Now, we can determine the uncertainty of future inflation by finding the difference between the anticipated future inflation rate and the break-even inflation rate:\nUncertainty of future inflation = Anticipated future inflation - Break-even inflation rate\n\nStep 7: Plugging in the values:\nUncertainty of future inflation = 3.5% - 5% = -1.5%\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty of future inflation is -1.5%."

Sullivan calculates how many bond futures are required to shield the company's total exposure to interest rate risk. The asset portfolio has a basis point value (BPV) of 96,000, while the liability portfolio's BPV is 44,000. Based on the extra data about bond futures that Sullivan has gathered in Exhibit 1, how many five-year note futures contracts need to be sold to readjust the immunizing portfolio?",
        "output": [
            "1. Calculate the total exposure to interest rate risk for the asset and liability portfolios separately:\n\nTotal exposure for the asset portfolio:\nTotal BPV = $96,000\nTotal exposure = Total BPV / 10000 = 96,000 / 10,000 = 9.6\n\nTotal exposure for the liability portfolio:\nTotal BPV = $44,000\nTotal exposure = Total BPV / 10000 = 44,000 / 10,000 = 4.4\n\n2. Calculate the net exposure to interest rate risk:\nNet exposure = Total exposure of the asset portfolio - Total exposure of the liability portfolio\nNet exposure = 9.6 - 4.4 = 5.2\n\n3. Calculate the number of bond futures contracts needed to hedge the net exposure:\nSince we are given the Modified duration and BPV per 100,000 in par value for 5-year T-Note futures:\nBPV per contract = BPV per 100,000 in par value / 100,000\nBPV per contract = 47.22 / 100,000 = 0.0004722\n\nThe number of contracts = Net exposure / (Modified duration * BPV per contract)\nNumber of contracts = 5.2 / (4.8 * 0.0004722)\n\n4. Calculate the Conversion factor for the cheapest-to-deliver option for 5-year note futures which is 0.88:\n\nTrue Hedge Ratio = Conversion factor * Price of Bond Futures / Price of the Bond\nTrue Hedge Ratio = 0.88 * (1 / (1 + Yield to maturity)) / Conversion factor\n\n5. With all the calculations, we can now determine the number of five-year note futures contracts needed to hedge the portfolio exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the number of five-year note futures contracts needed to shield the company's total exposure to interest rate risk."

Given that the current beta is 1.2, the initial beta of the portfolio is 1.2.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the new target beta for the portfolio.\nThe target beta is 0.9, which is the desired beta of the portfolio after employing the futures contract.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the beta impact of each futures contract.\nThe beta of each futures contract is 0.95. By selling futures contracts, the beta of the portfolio will decrease by the product of the beta of each contract and the number of contracts sold.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the beta reduction needed.\nTo reduce the beta from 1.2 to 0.9, the beta reduction needed is 1.2 - 0.9 = 0.3.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of futures contracts required.\nTo find the number of futures contracts needed, divide the beta reduction needed by the beta impact of each futures contract:\nNumber of contracts = Beta reduction needed / Beta impact of each contract\nNumber of contracts = 0.3 / 0.95 = 0.3158\n\nStep 6: Since you cannot sell a fraction of a futures contract, round up to the nearest whole number.\nRounding up 0.3158 to the nearest whole number, we get 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1."

Calculate the predicted worth of a zero-coupon bond after a year for each possible rating by multiplying the face value by the discount factor:\n\n- For AA rating: $1000 * 0.98387 = $983.87\n- For A rating: $1000 * 0.98039 = $980.39\n- For BBB rating: $1000 * 0.96154 = $961.54\n\nTherefore, the answer is $983.87."

        "output": [
            "Step 1: Calculate the initial interest rate implied by selling the interest rate futures contract at 98.00. Since futures contracts are priced at 100.00 - contract price, the initial implied interest rate is 100.00 - 98.00 = 2.00%.\n\nStep 2: Thompson ended up borrowing directly from the market at 2.4% after six months. This is higher than the initial implied interest rate from the futures contract.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the net impact of the hedge by comparing the futures contract price when Thompson sold it (98.00) with the price when he closed the position (97.00). The difference is 98.00 - 97.00 = 1.00 basis point.\n\nStep 4: Since Thompson sold the contract at 98.00 and closed it at 97.00, he effectively locked in a borrowing rate that was 1.00 basis point lower than the initial implied rate.\n\nTherefore, the overall borrowing rate throughout this procedure would be the initial implied rate of 2.00% minus the 1.00 basis point improvement from the hedge, resulting in an overall borrowing rate of 1.99%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.99%."

As for Assertive Fund, its returns follow a normal distribution with an average of 7% and a standard deviation of 15%. The top executives have tasked a financial analyst to calculate the possibility that the returns on the merged portfolio might surpass 26%.

The probability represents the likelihood of the merged portfolio's return exceeding 26%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 0.0584 or 5.84%."

        "output": [
            "1. First, we need to convert the 5% return over six weeks into a yearly return. \n\n2. There are 52 weeks in a year, so to find the yearly return, we need to first calculate how many six-week periods are there in a year by dividing 52 weeks by 6 weeks.\n\n3. 52 weeks ÷ 6 weeks ≈ 8.67 (rounded up to 9 for simplicity)\n\n4. This means there are 9 six-week periods in a year.\n\n5. To calculate the yearly return, we need to compound the weekly return over the 9 six-week periods. \n\n6. The formula for compound interest is: Final Amount = Initial Amount * (1 + r)^n, where r is the rate of return and n is the number of periods.\n\n7. Plugging in the values, we get: Final Amount = Initial Amount * (1 + 0.05)^9\n\n8. To find the yearly return, subtract the initial amount from the final amount and convert it to a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a 49.62% yearly return."

What is the value of this swap?",
        "output": [
            "Step 1: Calculate the fixed payments at the current fixed rate of 1.4853%.\n\nFixed Payment = Fixed Rate × Notional Principle = 1.4853% × $100,000,000 = $1,485,300\n\nStep 2: Determine the present value of the floating payments based on the rates in the table.\n\nFor the first year:\nFloating Payment = MRR × Notional Principle = 1% × $100,000,000 = $1,000,000\nPresent Value = Floating Payment / (1 + MRR) = $1,000,000 / (1 + 1%) = $990,099.01\n\nFor the second year:\nFloating Payment = 1.5% × $100,000,000 = $1,500,000\nPresent Value = $1,500,000 / (1 + 1.5%) = $1,476,377.95\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total present value of floating payments.\n\nTotal Present Value of Floating Payments = Present Value Year 1 + Present Value Year 2 = $990,099.01 + $1,476,377.95 = $2,466,476.96\n\nStep 4: Calculate the value of the swap by comparing the fixed payment with the total present value of floating payments.\n\nValue of Swap = Fixed Payment - Total Present Value of Floating Payments = $1,485,300 - $2,466,476.96\n\nTherefore, the answer is -$981,176.96."

        "output": [
            "Step 1: Understand the components involved in an interest rate swap:\n- In an interest rate swap, two parties exchange interest rate payments. One party typically pays a fixed interest rate, while the other pays a floating interest rate based on a reference rate (e.g., LIBOR).\n- The fixed interest rate in an interest rate swap is determined based on market conditions, such as the yield on government bonds and swap spreads.\n\nStep 2: Determine the fixed interest rate paid in the interest rate swap:\n- The fixed interest rate paid by the fixed payer in an interest rate swap is equal to the yield on the government bond plus the swap spread.\n- Given:\n  - Yield on the five-year Treasury bond = 2%\n  - Swap spread = 50 basis points (bps)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the fixed interest rate paid in the interest rate swap:\n- Convert the yield on the Treasury bond and the swap spread into decimal form:\n  - Yield on the Treasury bond = 2% = 0.02\n  - Swap spread = 50 bps = 0.005 (50 bps is equivalent to 0.5% or 0.005 in decimal form)\n- Add the yield on the Treasury bond and the swap spread to get the fixed interest rate:\n  - Fixed interest rate = Yield on Treasury bond + Swap spread\n  - Fixed interest rate = 0.02 + 0.005\n  - Fixed interest rate = 0.025 or 2.5%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.5%."

Determine if there is an impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Since the fair value of the investment is provided as $940 thousand, we will use this as the recoverable amount for simplicity.\n\n3.

The forward price of a zero-coupon bond with a two-year term that begins in three years is established at 0.8479. What's the current price of a zero-coupon bond that matures in five years?",
        "output": [
            "Step 1: Calculate the present value of the zero-coupon bond with a one-year term, using a yield of 4.0%.

This calculation is done by discounting the forward price back to the present:\n\\[Current\\ Price = Forward\\ Price \\times (1 + Yield\\ on\\ 3\\ Year\\ Bond)^{Time}\\]\n\nStep 6: Calculate the present value of a zero-coupon bond that matures in five years using the prices of the one-year, two-year, and three-year zero-coupon bonds. This can be done by discounting the face value of the five-year bond by using the yields of the corresponding zero-coupon bonds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is calculated based on the above steps."

In this case, the discount is 100 - 99.5 = 0.5.\n\n4. **Determine the Days to Maturity**: The Treasury Bill has a maturity of 30 days.\n\n5. **Calculate the Yield on the Treasury Bill**: To find the yield (YTM) on the Treasury Bill, we need to calculate the discount as a percentage of the face value and then annualize it to get the Equivalent YTM.\n\n6. **Calculate the Equivalent YTM**: To calculate the annualized yield, use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Equivalent YTM} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Discount} \\times 365}{\\text{Days to Maturity}} \\right) \\times 100\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is 73.0."

        "output": [
            "1. First, we need to calculate the annual coupon payment the bondholder receives. The coupon rate is 5% of the par value, which means the annual coupon payment is $5 for a bond with a face value of $100.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine the yield-to-maturity (YTM) of the bond, which is 7%.\n\n3. We can now calculate the present value of the bond's cash flows. Since the bond has 3 years left until maturity, we will have 3 cash flows: the annual coupon payment and the par value received at maturity.\n\n4. The present value of the annual coupon payment can be calculated using the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity:\n   PV(Coupon payments) = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where\n   C = Annual coupon payment\n   r = Yield-to-maturity rate\n   n = Number of periods\n\n5. The present value of the par value received at maturity can be calculated using the formula for the present value of a single cash flow:\n   PV(Par value) = F / (1 + r)^n, where\n   F = Face value (par value) of the bond\n\n6. Adding the present values of the coupon payments and the par value will give us the total present value of the bond.\n\n7. The Macaulay duration of a bond is a weighted average of the times until each cash flow is received, weighted by the present value of the cash flow. It is calculated using the following formula:\n   Macaulay duration = [Σ (t * PVt) / PV], where\n   t = Time until the cash flow is received\n   PVt = Present value of the cash flow at time t\n   PV = Total present value of the bond\n\nTherefore, the answer is computed following the above steps."

        "question": "The American company named BBQ Company has exported steel to an English firm and is expected to receive payment of 3,600,000 GBP in six months, which the firm will then convert into dollars. To protect against currency risk, BBQ Company decided to enter into a 6 month forward contract to sell GBP at 1.5512USD/GBP. After three months have passed, now, the spot exchange market rate is 1.5500 USD/GBP for bid and 1.5505 for ask. Given the information on the spot exchange market rate, forward rates, and the 90-Day Libor, what is the mark-to-market value for BBQ Company's forward position?",

        "question": "Jane Doe possesses a spreadsheet comprised of 108 monthly returns for shares in the ABC Company. She constructs a software program that employs bootstrap resampling to generate 200 resamples of the ABC data by sampling with replacement. Each resample similarly contains 108 data points. Doe's software measures the average of all 200 resamples and determines that the mean of these 200 resample averages is 0.0261. The software then subtracts 0.0261 from all 200 resample averages, squares each of these 200 differences, and sums up the squared differences. The outcome is 0.835. Subsequently, the software calculates an estimation of the standard error of the sample average. What is the estimated standard error of the sample average?",

Subtracting 0.0261 from each of the 200 resample averages, squaring the differences, and summing them up gives a value of 0.835.\n3. The formula to calculate the standard error of the sample average is: standard error = sqrt(sum of squared differences / (n-1)), where n is the number of resamples.\n\nGiven that the sum of squared differences is 0.835, and the number of resamples is 200, we can plug these values into the formula to find the estimated standard error of the sample average.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $ \\sqrt{\\frac{0.835}{199}} = 0.047$."

        "question": "Duhamel starts reviewing the asset collection of an American citizen, Brooke Jensen. Jensen's investments are in American and European securities. On January 1, 2019, Jensen held assets of USD 50 million and EUR 50 million, distributed between shares and bonds. The exchange rate on this day was 1.1 USD/EUR. A year later, on January 1, 2020, the value of Jensen's European asset increased from EUR 50 million to EUR 54 million, having EUR 20 million in shares and EUR 34 million in bonds. The USD/EUR exchange rate at this time is 1.16. Can you determine the domestic currency return on Jensen's European portfolio over the preceding year?",
        "output": [
            "1. We need to calculate the initial value of Jensen's European assets in USD on January 1, 2019.\n   Initial value in USD = EUR 50 million * 1.1 USD/EUR = USD 55 million\n\n2. Next, we calculate the final value of Jensen's European assets in USD on January 1, 2020.\n   Shares in USD = EUR 20 million * 1.16 USD/EUR = USD 23.2 million\n   Bonds in USD = EUR 34 million * 1.16 USD/EUR = USD 39.44 million\n   Final value in USD = USD 23.2 million + USD 39.44 million = USD 62.64 million\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the domestic currency return on Jensen's European portfolio over the preceding year.\n   Domestic currency return = (Final value - Initial value) / Initial value * 100%\n   Domestic currency return = (USD 62.64 million - USD 55 million) / USD 55 million * 100%\n   Domestic currency return = USD 7.64 million / USD 55 million * 100%\n   Domestic currency return = 13.89%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13.89%."

Given that 99% of the sales fall within the $230,000 to $480,000 range, we can deduce that this range corresponds to μ ± 3σ.
