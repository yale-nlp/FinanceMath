            "\n\nFirst, we should understand the financial definition of \\textit{double-declining balance depreciation}. \\textit{Depreciation is used to recover the cost of an asset over its lifetime.} So the amount of depreciation for double-declining balance depreciation is derived by the formula `` ((property cost - salvage value) / total amount of years) * double declining rate''. For example, if double-declining rate is 20% and total amount of years is 10, the declining rate for year 1 is (20%) / 10 = 2% = double-declining rate of 1st year, the declining rate for year 2 is (20%) / (10-1) = 20% / 9 = 2.22% = double-declining rate of 2nd year, ..., and so on. `Double-dclining rate of the year is the result of ` [double-declining rate for an original property] / [remaining number of years after each year].\n\nSecond, you need to find the estimated useful life-time of property. Most questions in Codility have information in paragraphs. You can encode the paragraphs into numerical vectors. For example, if the above financial definition is expressed as a paragraph, the English paragraph can be translated into a numerical vector with an encoding approach, such as Word2Vec. Once all sentences are encoded into numerical vectors, any filtering operations can be made with standard techniques like machine learning. For example, if useful life of property is included within a paragraph, you can find the sentence including the useful life of property using a searching technique and convert corresponding sentence into a numerical value.\n\nThe above solution may not be appropriate for Expert systems which should be able to solve the question by itself without information outside of given statement.\n\nWhat is the most appropriate solution to answer the question which financial experts can figure out in 10 seconds? Do knowledge representation and inference approaches work? Or is there any irreducible complexity which humans innately have or not actually have?\n\nComment: Is there a question somewhere?\n\nComment: This is not a primary question, sir.

You can monitor the recent artificial intelligence approaches in robotics research environment.\n\nComment: Don't you think the irreducible complexity of the human brain is important in"

The ratio of Gross Margin to Net Sales represents the …\n\nAnswer to the question is `0.75`\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe gross profit margin of an income statement represents the percent of total revenue that exceeds cost of goods sold. The ratio of Gross Margin to Net Sales represents the percentage of financial gain that a company makes on the price of its product.\n\nFor example, if your business is in the widget business, then $50 of revenue represents the price that your customer paid for one of your widgets ($50). Cost of Goods Sold, which is the direct cost of producing widgets, represents the cost to your company to manufacture that widget. Let's assume, for the sake of illustration, that Cost of Goods Sold is $20. This means that your gross profit, that is, the amount that you have after the deduction of Cost of Goods Sold from your Revenue, is $50 minus $20 or $30. The gross profit of $30 represents the amount that can be used to pay overhead expenses and to pay salaries of your employees.\n\nSo let's see how we get to an answer now:\nCosts of Good Sold - 20%\n ($20)\nTotal Sales - 110% (30%)\n($110)\nGross Profit Margin is 7(20/110) or 7/110-x or 7/11 = .75%\n\nPlease share your approach, thoughts, ideas and thoughts.

Python is fast and excel is not. For example, a simple stock price timesyle and volatility analysis takes forever in Excel but these can be done in just seconds with ```pandas```. Shanghai Stock Exchange is already pretty fast by itself, but a python request for stock information is even faster. At the same time, there is no need to copy the Pandas library to our computer. It is all done when you start your python program.\n\nComment: If this was actually the question, then it is very bad. \"IF a financial expert predicts...\" -- all it takes to answer the question is one person saying \"I predict a $2 dividend next year\". There is no calculation involved.\n\nComment: @Acccumulation I added my question\n\nComment: As an aside, you cannot divide anything by 0, so you should add a clause that says `$2` cannot happen"

Thank you.\n\nComment: Think about the definition of equity and debt, and how important cashflow and cost of capital are in valuation. $X$ capital will have more weight on equity than debt. And the structure you are asked is 50% on each.\n\nComment: @Jacob Have you meant `Debt to Equity` and `Cost of Capital` ?\n\nComment: I meant debt and equity. And yes, this will make its way to capital structure, cost of capital etc. Think of the V-Sigma trade-off, with a small part should be played by bankruptcy cost.\n\nAnswer: The question is whether you want to indeed take into account the new cost of capital of the business under the altered capital structure. Otherwise there is nothing complex.\n\nIf the answer is yes, don't forget that the business has the full option to raise more money through debt financing (bonds and the like) through banks/pension mutual funds/life insurers rather than stock markets.\n\nComment: Your answer could be improved with additional supporting information.

Based on the question, the DV01 would be 0.085, and the regression beta coefficient is 1.1. In addition, let's define one more value called the Hedge Ratio (i.e. the ratio or proportion of the hedge instrument against the hedgee instrument). Therefore, you need to input the ratio of TIPS (the hedge instrument) against the hedgee instrument (T-bond). There is one integer called '/c=<value>', in which the value of c should be the integer you want to input. Therefore, if you input 2, it assigns the value 2 to the c. In addition, since there are multiple inputs per question, there are two numbers attached to the end of the parameter identified by the 'c' letter as in '/c=1/2/3...'. However, your current input only has one input, in which the answer is '1'. Therefore, '/c=1/1' is sufficient to input the answer '1'.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage change of the regressand based on the regression slope and the DV01. The hedge ratio (i.e. the proportion of the hedge ratio) can be calculated by the equation, Change in B = beta * DV01. Therefore, we can use this math-language parameter called 'Math Exp'. The format of 'Math Exp' is the same to mathematics. Each math-language format is explained below as you can see when you scroll down this document window.

Ok, so what's a standard deviation.\n\nThe standard deviation of an random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is classified as a measure of dispersion or variability around the mean or expected value. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. Since variance is a squared variable and since we keep the units of the squared variable, the unit of the standard deviation is the same as the unit of the original variable.\n\nSuppose a random variable X is continuous with probability density function f(x), and mean μ. Then the standard deviation of X, denoted σx or σ, is defined as:\n\nif X has underlying continuous distribution function F(x) then\n\nThe standard deviation is non-negative, but may be zero.

The coefficients of the first term on the RHS will be the $\\beta$'s in the earlier regression.\n\nIn this case, the regression with one lag of $X_t$ on its $p=1$ lag is AR(1) with this intercept and coefficient and we can reverse the regression to obtain $Y_t-a$ with the component of the one lag of $X_t$ \"removed\". It looks like the coefficients of the regression are $a=\\alpha = 293.5742$ and $b=\\rho = 0.9387$ so our formula for $Y_t-a$ would be\n\n$Y_t-a=\\rho(Y_{t-1}-a)+\\zeta_t$ where $\\zeta_t$ is white noise with mean $0$ and variance $1-a^2$.\n\nTo find the long term average we take the expected value of $Y_t-a.$ The expected value of white noise is $0$, and the distribution of $Y_{t-1}-a$ (multiplied by $\\rho$) is\n\n$Z \\sim N(K,\\sigma^2)$ where $K=\\alpha\\rho$ and $\\sigma^2 = (1-(\\alpha\\rho)^2)$. This is because the distribution of $Y_t-a$ is normal with expected value $a$ and variance $1-a^2$ which is $\\sigma^2$; and the distribution of $Y_{t"

            "\n\nWhat is the financial leverage?\nOne of the four criteria which determine credit rating is financial leverage which refers to the amount of various sorts of borrowings, in comparison to the balance sheet lines that attract borrowings inexpensively: shareholders’ equity for example.\nThe ratio is to be computed by dividing the volume of financial obligations on the balance sheet by the rest of the balance sheet lines (in the given example: liabilities and equity). The result reflects how big the amount of debt is and indicates corresponding risks.\nThe higher the leverage (the higher the debt-equity ratio) is, the more leverage the business has.\nNoteworthy in this context is also the capitalization ratio, which refers to the amount of equity at the same time as net borrowings. For example, it can be computed considering the balance sheet lines liabilities and equity. The same applies if one considers the balance sheet lines and liabilities equity and provision as well as liabilities equity and provision on the one hand and liabilities and equity on the other hand. A low equity capitalization or low net borrowing shows low financial risk and a big equity capitalization or big net borrowings points to high risk. Then we know that stock prices and the own equity capital have an inverse relationship with each other. Both quotations are meant to get at the same value based on the balance sheet. Apart from this, the balance sheet shows cash flows over time and sometimes even a time correction is necessary. And last but not least, measurement errors due to the time of measurement are always there.\nA high equity capitalization at the same time as the debt ratio lead to the advantage that the businesses capital costs are lower compared to totally equity-financed businesses.\n\nSo, there are two ways to assess the financial leverage:\n|                           | scale         |   units   |\n| ------------------------- |:--------------:|:---------:|\n| Debt ratio                 | -> financial ratio | -> %. |\n| Finance leverage ratio      | {1 - financial ratio)|  -> |\n|                           |                     | units .|\n|                           |                     |  -----:|\n|                           |                     |     1. |\n\nBrief description regarding the table:\nLet’s make"

If you want to, and are ready to save your result, you could perform a Cognos Anti-Code Challenge. :)\n\nComment: Sorry, but this site is not intended or designed for this kind of challenge in this manner.\n\nComment: @RobertJamesCurry This makes no sense … The OP is asking answerers to give him the solutions to help him study, which is fine and would make a good question on its own. What appears to have happened is that a company which values people who have the right answer to this question has set up a challenge where they would like people to prove that they do, in fact, have the right answer. There is **no denying** that this is a Math problem. It **is** on-topic.\n\nComment: Don’t offer to post it as an edit though :-)\n\nComment: Sorry I was not clear, but a system can be build to detect the person who gives the right answer has the original solution or not.\n\nComment: Are these market prices or theoretic ones?\n\nComment: price in the OTC market.\n\nComment: I don't understand why editors deleted previous posts. This is not a challenge from an online game or something like that, but one of the question testing the knowledge of market surviving, and what calculation required to survive in this technology company. I asked question here because it is very hard to get the right answer without the right reference or info.\n\nComment: Did anybody able to figure out the answer?\n\nAnswer: Usually coupon payment take place 1 month in advance.

It is [question_type],[[variable_info]],[number_with_unit],[number_with_currency_unit] like 'specific_answer question,name of a financial variable, numbers w/ unit, numbers w/ currency unit'.

First, the current month's return correlation is 56%. Second, the current month's correlation is further below the long-term mean value of the return correlation, the mean reverting rate kick in and the projected next month's return correlation will be higher. Third, the projected next month's return correlation will be less than the long-term mean value. Therefore, the answer it is likely around Blah thats when opinions will start.\n\\end{code}\n\nLink to data: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qua6D-aaAGH-tuZ2pImJbK3N7k91"

Where does the other 500,000 come from? We have to check the tax code to figure out if we are required to remove part of the income or not. Because we are experts, we know from tax code that the tax law states our taxable income is the pretax revenue minus our cost of revenue. OK, but what is the cost of revenue? The cost of revenue is the cost of goods sold along with the depreciation expense.\nBased on the requirements, the depreciation expense is 100000, and the cost of revenue is 3000000.\nHow do we know? The depreciation is only (Pre Tax Revenue/8(years) *1.5*, because the tax deductible amount of the depreciation expense is only25%. The cost of goods sold is basically the pre tax income minus the depreciation plus the other deductions.\nAnswer: The answer is 350000 (1000000*35%)\n\nQuestion 1: How can I parse the question from a dataset of question?\n\nQuestion 2: If another question has multiple conditions such as 'given that the depreciation is 100000 and the revenue is 1500000', how to parse it from dataset?\n\nI want to know how should I answer the question and use machine-learning to evaluate the answer?\n\nAnswer: This can be implemented using Regex and rule based approach to parse the data."

Since the sales revenue is given in the unit of million, you have to take the Million times £85. You need to use a multiplication formula to refer the unit row of Million, I suggest you to use the SUMIF function. Let's assume the following formula,\n\n=SUMIF(Sheet1!$A$3:$A$4,Sheet1!$B$5,Sheet1!$B$3:$B$4)\n\nNote: You need to refer to a unit column, so A3:A4.\n\nThe calculated value is £85,000,000 (Million times £85). Now, calculate the total cost for each sales. It is £650. The company can cover the varible costs by selling 10 million units.\n\nStill you have to cover their fixed costs. Just check the fixed operating costs and the fixed financial costs from the table, and subtract £650 from 50 to get £435. If you could express the revenue by a unit, it wouldn't be difficult. Add the following formula on your calculation line.\n=SUMIF(Sheet1!$A$3:$A$4,\"1\",Sheet1!$B$3:$B$4)\n\nThen, you can get the sum which means the fixed costs in your formula.

            "\nLet's look at the given information. Ppg=30. I=110. Ppdr=20.\nLet's calculate the elasticity of demand for groceries first.\nQdpg=(80-30×3)+110×0.1+20×0.5=89.\nThe derivate of this is (80-30×3)=80-90=-10. The Price elasticity ofdemand is thusly -10/80=-0.125 Therefore the answer is -0.125.\nWhat is the value of this?\nWe cannot know if the demand is elastic or inelastic.\nThis is because PPG=30 and thusly 0.125×30≠±1.\nThe following values make the demand for groceries elastic:\n-0.125 × 15 = -1.875 < −1 elastic demand.\n-0.125 × 30 = -3.75 < −1 elastic demand.\n-0.125 × 45 = -5.625 < −1 elastic demand.\nThe following values make the demand for groceries inelastic:\n-0.125 × 10 = -1.25 > −1. inelastic demand.\n-0.125 × 10 = -0.125 > −1. inelastic demand.\n-0.125 × 10 = -0.0625 > −1. inelastic demand.\n\nComment: This question is essentially asking for an answer on a time-limited quiz, and this is not the mailing-list to do it on.\n\nAnswer: As you probably have been told, this question is far to complicated to be solved with a single line of code. In python you can easily solve the demand equation but it will be far to complicated for people who know nothing about the equation to read and use. And I don't think you will find any reasonable solution that only contains a few lines.\n\nNontheless, I tried to help you with your actual question.\n\n\\begin{code}\n\ndef price_elasticity(p1,p"

So, the total of cash that the company paid to vendors will be less than $55.\n\nStep 2: So, there is a possibility that there were cash discounts. To answer the question, we need to consider that there were discounts. Discounts would mean further increase in payables and decrease in receivables. Whereas, this situation is opposite. So, let say that there were no discounts at all.\n\nStep 3: By the same reasoning in step 1, you will use net change in current assets to find the doucumented cash disbursements.

            " First of all we should obtain the tax rate from the question = 40%. Bob Inc. will apply straight-line depreciation method to this production equipment.\n\nNow we should know the useful life of the production equipment, either 5 or 6 years. It depends on which amount of tax allowed by the tax department. At this stage the question is asked by the tax department so this is a subjective question not objective one. Thus, tax payable is not considered yet.\nWe need to compare the tax-payable by using different useful lives and find out the lasting mistake resulted by 5 years when we use 6 years useful life. Furthermore, we need to find out what is the initial book value of the production equipment when we adopt different useful lives. This situation indicates the calculation of MACRS needs to use regulation 1.168(i)(3) or regulation 1.168(i)(4). Now, the company will depreciate a prior year asset by adopting a new useful life. Therefore, the asset is looked back.\nWhen the asset is put into use bonus depreciation will not be interested in. But if the asset is acquired and placed in service in the same taxable year 20% bonus applies to new assets.\nTake a look at the major provisions first:\nRev. Proc. 2011-14, MACRS, as it applies to the 20 percent bonus depreciation deduction, says that:\n- New Tangible Property with a class life of 20 years or less will use the half-year convention.\n- New Tangible Property with a class life of 20 years or longer will use the Mid-month Convention.\nTo apply the rules, we look back at year 2010 when the production equipment was put into service. 80% first year bonus depreciation is applicable for the production equipment if it is placed in service on Sept. 17, 2010 to Dec. 31, 2010. There is no deduction for Section 179 expense since the property is not acquired and put in service in that year.\n[source](https://www.studentoffortune.com/question/us-tax-inflation-deprecation-writeoffs-where-does-this-make-sense-at"

He explains that by definition, the ratio is theoretically scientific; even more so since the initial cash investment is converted to a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, while the initial cash outflow associated with the investment is converted to debt service, dramatically reducing risk by accounting for interest on debt.\n\nSince we understood the Cash-on-Cash,\n-we now try to find \"cash generated from a property\".(check the exhibit 1)\n\n• This is where the cash-on-cash return brings us immense clarity.

For $x = \\mu$, we get $P(S > \\mu | \\mu , \\sigma)= (1- \\Phi(0)) = 1/2= 0.5$.\n\nSo, $P(x < \\mu)= P(S \\le \\mu)= 1- P(S > \\mu)= 1- 0.5= 0.5$\n\nNow, considering your variables $X$, $Y$ is all you ake about. First, you have that $ S=\\frac{Y- \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0,1)$, so $S$ follows a standard normal distribution. Also, for $Z= \\frac{X- \\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim N(0,1)$, $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution too.\n\n$P(X= x)= P(Z= x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} P(x)= \\frac{1}{\\sigma} f_X(x), x= \\sigma Z$\n\nBy this, I can get $P(X= \\sigma)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma}P(\\sigma)= \\frac{1}{\\sigma} f_X(\\sigma)$, so   $P(\\sigma)= \\sigma f_X(\\sigma)$ and\n\n$\\sigma P(\\sigma)= \\sigma f_X(\\sigma)$ and\n\n$P(\\mu)= P(\\mu / \\sigma) = P(0) = 0.5$.\n\nIn statistical, it is usually easy using the standard normal curve table or software to get $Z$."

This puts the (no put option) stock price for the asset in question at $8$. Now, to to solve for possible gains.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, it is helpful to know all of the properties of stocks and derivatives. For our specific scenario, we have a European put option that is in the money, so we know that the value is nonzero $> 0$. Now we are working with the European put option, so we can use the Black-Formula to calculate the payoff as follows:\n$$\n       C = e^{-(r_{t}-q-\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2})(T-t)} [S(t) - K]^{+}+Ke^{-r_{t}(T-t)}\n$$\nIt is more helpful to remember the formula $\\$0 = PV(K)\\cdot e^{-r(T-t)}$ which can help you to avoid formulas that max out for our current derivative.\n\nSince there is an election approaching, we know that there will be a change in monetary policy in the environment, and possibly in interest rates as well, so this could use some adjusting for but probably (since we're dealing with hundreds of"

EV is a company's enterprise value, or the value of its equity plus debt, minus cash.\n\nSecondly according to the question, we need to know how much worth the company\nis. We need to use the formula at once.\nThe equity of the company is $500 million × $7 = $3500 million. The debt of the company is $3500 million because that's what we have been said already. And we have that the company has $3500 million cash in hand. Here we can see that the company has no equity or debt.\nWe need to calculate the market value of the company first.\nThat is 500 million × $7 = $3500million.\nIn this case, MV(=500m×$7) = EV(=500m×$7+3500m−3500m) = 500m × $7.\n\nNow we need to calculate sales, and we need to multiply $3000 million net sales and divide it by 10 = $300 million, around about $300 million sales.\n\nWe also need to calculate EV/CE. We do that by dividing 500 million ordinary shares into $3500 million enterprise value. here we can see that the answer is 7. We need to get the answer of EV/EBIT.\nWe can get this by using the following formula:\nEBIT * (1 – C.Tax.Rate)\nHere we do not know the tax rate.\nThere should be some other ways:\nNote: EV to Sales actually means the same thing as EV to EBIT and can be calculated the same way.\n\nAccording to the given formulas, the answer should be as follows.\n$3500 million enterprise value / $ 300 million sales = 11.6x\n\nOnce you have all of the figures, you should have precisely the same numbers presented to you in the question. You then simply have to:\n\n$3500 / $1500 = 2.33% (approx)\nHere, the Answer is EV to Sales is"

Remember, an interview is supposed to be conversational and you are acting in the role of an expert, you will naturally ask the interviewer the underlying question from what he/she is actually asking, so naturally you will ask the interviewer. The answer to this from the interviewer is \"What is the probability that EBIT covers Interest with an excess of $4 million?\".\n\nNow, you need to use the Poisson Distance Calculator to find out the likelihood that EBIT would exceed $48 million. You need to check different scenarios like whether EBIT can be below 28 or above 28, and 36 as that is the lowest value which is equally probable.\nIf your answer is 75%, then you need to include a statement like, I have considered a possibility that if EBIT varies within the expected range of 36-48 which is 12, the safety level is 5 (to have an additional 4 million excess) and probability that the EBIT is at least Low+Safety is 75%, hence probability of EBIT being less than Low-Safety is 25%, hence probability of Low-Safety to Luxury for the given situation is < 25% ---> (1-25% is greater than 75% which is the answer for the given situation). All calculations should be done in the Language Model.\n\nHint: If, for example, the value of EBIT ranges between $36 mln and $48 mln, which are equally probable, then for every $1 mln in excess, the probability of EBIT/interest being less than Luxury = 1% (instead of 4%).

For example: 'So, based on a given discount rate and number of interest periods, a first PVF is ...'.

Then you tried to estimate the range of obvious probability, throw them to said friend. Such as: 'How would I let an estimate from the possible range?'. The range could be from 0.0 to 10.0, so tried with different group of round numbers, say from 1.0 to 9.0 then from 10.0 to 99.0 then 100.0 to 5555.5. Friend did not pass these, you are trying harder like continuing to input 6500.0.\n3. Noticing this friend's expression, thought the value could be 3000.0.\n4. Ah, near to 1/6 which is the given answer for me!\n5. Tested 2000.0, friend said yes.\n6. Understood, keep memory this code to use next step: 2000.0, it is here the answer.\n7. Input 6000.0 then 1600.0, friend said likelihoods of 1/6 and 1/10 respectively. Is that so?\n8. Yes, as the given answer of 1/6 is the same as 6000.0. And, freshly updated to 1/10 is the same as 1600.0.\n9. Therefore, you understood this pattern for you to total up the number of possible dice values.\n10. So if rolling the dice, the likelihood that number 1 is on top is 1/6, what are the chances of this happening?\n11. The correct answer is 1600.0.\n12.

            " First quantify the exposure to the market interest rates.\n\nYou could consult your favorite finance textbook for this next bit of background. But here is a quick refresher to remember it by: When market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and bond yields rise to reflect that fall in prices. And vice versa when interest rates fall. So when John the retirement manager went to the market to create the portfolio of bonds he needed to back his fund's pension obligations, the bond prices he paid to buy them reflected the then market interest rate. That is, the price he paid for an 8% ten year bond in a market of 8% 10 year bonds was lower than the price he would have paid if he had bought that same bond in a market of 10% 10 year bonds. Similarly, a 10% premium bond in a market of premium bonds paying 12% will be at a lower price than the same bond in a market of premium bonds paying 10%. The return on your investment at holding to maturity does not depend on what the prices were when you bought your bonds. The price will always be 100 at maturity. But if you are an active manager, who holds and sells positions in bond or equity portfolios on a regular basis, being able to anticipate the way prices will react to market interest rates is vital. For a lesson in how not to do that, have a look at Moore's paper \"Property-Liability Asset Management during the Last Financial Crisis\"\nJohn's retirement liabilities are akin to investment in a portfolio of premium bonds that all mature in one year. Given the market value of the fund's premium bonds at the base rates, if the market rates rise by 100 basis points or 1% what will be the change in market value of the fund's assets relative to the same change in the value of its liabilities caused by the change in market interest rates?\n\nThe difference between the change in value of the assets and the change in value of liabilities is the effective duration of the portfolio. In a market of 1% risk free risk-less instantaneously repaying lombard type loans issued by the Bank of England, what would be the price"

            " Before answering questions, make sure you understand the equations given in the problems. The formula for the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) is as follows:\n\nHE / MRP + b\n\nHE = Expected return of an investment\nMRPP = Expected market risk premium (6% in the question above)\nb = Beta (for example: if the beta is 1, it means that the risk is the same as the market risk and if the beta is 0.5, it means that the risk is half of the market risk)\nTherefore, the individual required expected return (he) or the predicted return of Investment A using the Capital Assets Pricing Model can be calculated as follows:\n\nHE = MRP + B (6%) + 2.50 (1.5) = 6 + 3.75 = 9.75%\n\nObviously, this is just an example and your calculations might be different than this.\n\nAt some point in the competition, you will meet a large term which we call it a jellumph word. An example is the above question which has required the term CAPM.\n\nYou should google it to get the information you want about the question. Here's a link to the Wikipedia that explains the CAPM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model\n\nBut do not make the answer as the same answer as in the wiki, because the expert can easily guess that you have met so far. If you have met the term, you are a financial expert. Therefore you need to look for the answer to the question yourself."

If we assume the fusion between B and U comes to a successful close, what will be the result of Smith’s merger arbitrage trade if he purchases 24,000 U shares at a rate of 20 euros per share, and goes short on 16,000 B shares at a rate of 45 euros per share?",

Given that we are attempting to respond this from an advantages point of view with no cost of merger arbitrage, the response to this inquiry is yes.\n\nStep 2 - U investment funds: first issue is which U offer cost Smith was truly paying at a similar time when B was at a cost of €45; appropriately, at the utilization or issuance cost of U, which was €50 at the time of the merger. We can, henceforth, safely rely on that the European corporate development was at a cost of 50 euros for every share. At the point when U's exchange cost settled after the proposal to €20, Smith found a value markup in U's offer cost and was qualified for benefit from the bid/offer spread between those two rates. In the U case the discount rate would be €0.70 and would be a standout amongst the most significant segments in the structure of Smith's merger arbitrage pay. To cross-check, we could take a gander at the present 2:3 offer proportion, from which you could infer that Smith’s offer cost would be joined with a cost rate of 50/1.5 = €27.\n\nStep 3 - Scenario Market Adjustment Premium: B needs to go short B. Before Smith makes the purchase, he sees that the wager costs more noteworthy than what the stock is authoritatively esteemed in the stock trade, and thinks about what might happen if, in the mean time, the stock exchange esteem somehow balanced with the normal offer value. Because of the stop decrease in the B stock cost from €50 to €45, Smith accepts that this may happen when in doubt, regardless of whether the merger doesn't work out: to put it plainly, he purchases protection against potential misfortune in the event that the market changes its mind about B and reduces the cost of shorting B in the share trading system from 45 to 40 and in the event that it additionally decides that the proper 'exchange cost' of U has fallen essentially from 20 to 15 in parallel with"

The FN is much higher than FP, so the model predicted mostly negative sentiment.\n\nGiven TN and FN, what is the true positive metric? You are thinking in the wrong way. You don’t get to know the true positive part from the results of this data. But from this data, you can get the true negative. Based on the corresponding numbers, TN = 96 and FN = 31, the true negative is TN / (TN + FN) = 0.75. The actual prediction is more accurate in the negative class than the positive class.\n\nBased on the above analysis, you can infer that the model has got the negative sentiment class right for the bulk of the data. So, the false positive should be more than the false negative. What is the false positive? You can get this value from the benchmark results. TP+FP=Actual class “1” and FN+TN= Actual class “0”, then the false positive(FP) = Actual class “1” - (TP+TN). In this case, FP=175.\n\nTherefore, the precision for the positive sentiment is 182/182+175.

            "\n\nStep 1: Compound Interest\nWhile tackling this interview straight away with some coding skills, the first immediate leap of logic is understanding the math pattern that you are about to build as well as rethink the problem itself. This is a problem about compound interest. The word \"compound\" just means \"combined with.\" Therefore, in essence, you could have avoided all future headaches if that was the way you phrased the question in the first place: how to calculate compound interest.\n\nThis is how you calculate compounding interest. The first step consists of telling how the interest is compounded. Many times, this interest is compounded yearly, semiannually, quarterly, etc. But in this case, this is a monthly compounded annual discount rate. So, 6.5% is the Annual percent you would earn in interest based on the principle (initial payment) on an annual basis. For this case, since the interest is compounded annually but Interest Rate is monthly mean we have to calculate Annual Interest Rate and Annual payment payment = principle × Annual Interest Rate.\n\nFor this reason, the annual money will be constant at 1200. After calculating the average payment it will provide you a end total balance. This will form the basis of a Cumulative interest formula which is calculated by adding interest rates depending on the nature of interest (monthly, yearly) for the initial total balance. The Balance required for next month is compound interest on the initial + amount you’re currently at. You can add all those values up for the principle and the interest rate. The outstanding balance for that given month PRICE will be deducted from that\nmonth's payment.\n/example: yearly compounded rate = (interest per month/12); monthly compounded rate = (interest per year/100)(12)\n\nStep 2:  Infinite Series\nThe form of the final output looks a lot like an infinite series:\nwhere a is the monthly payment of 1,200 and r is the annual interest rate of .065 (per year interest/12 (payments per year)).\nHere are the last few terms:\n\nr would be (1 - principal rate /12), n is the number of month, payment is (1,"

We can easily find the necessary details from Present of expected future net cash flows, fair value of plant, and revised estimate of useful life and residual value.\nThe useful life of the plant is 10 years as revealed from the table and its current age is 7 years which means 3 years of life are left.\nThe residual value of the plant is 200 dollars.\n\nTo answer [2], using the table information, we realize that the future net cash flows is 1,350 and its fair value is 1,225 that may help us to find out the 1,350 in more detail. Using revised estimate we find out that the remaining term of life is 3 years and the future net cash flows is 465. Assuming the existing net cash flows is equal for each period of time, and by deducting the future net cash flows from existing net cash flows in each year we determine the future net cash flows as follows: 1,350 - 465 - 465 - 465 = 0 etc. Net cash flows initially are 1,350 corresponding to 7 years of life. After 7 years the remaining cash inflows will be 465 corresponding to 3 years of life.

For example, suppose the limit price is 20.02. In this case, Ann is the first to sell. He sold 100 shares without problems. But for the remaining 300 he had to raise the price to 20.03. Then there are two alternatives: if Mary's shares are the first sold, then John can sell 300 shares at 20.03 and the remaining at 20.11. If Jeff's are the ones who sell first, it is slightly more complicated since Jeff's bid is for 1 transaction (400 shares) and 10 shares remain uncovered (20.02 < 20.11). Then, if those 10 are sold to Margaret, everything is fine. If no one wants to buy them, then the average price is 20.026\n\nI hope I've explained well. Otherwise, I ask you for more information.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have just reread the question, and this is somewhat different. You are asking for selling 1000 shares at £19.83 given that there are several buy purchases at this price and that no one wants to buy below it (that is 20.03). That is, they would buy them eagerly at 20.03 (the first bid less than 20.02). In this case, it would work as I described, that is, starting by selling 100 shares (limiting only to the first buy order). So it would be divided as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item 100 shares. Price 19.83. From (Jack and Margaretходя) getting 198.3 rounded to only 2 decimals. Ave price 19.83 and no changes in state.\n\\item 400 shares. Price 19.83. From (Jeff).

The question writer expected that you would add the five answer options together to get the total cost. Then, if you think about it, you could also just use the question to test modules on training technique. The five items all come under the heading of \"fixed costs\"... which are costs not linked to output. When we are talking about fixed costs, the various variables are listed and individually named because they are part of the question being asked. Then we come to the question itself. Should it be, \"how much would it cost to set up a new facility?\". Some readers have assumed that the \"cumulative expense\" refers to the total cost of purchase and instalment. Yet this question could also be a type of chestnut question, indicating that the correct answer is called an \"expense\". Here the first bullet point should be called \"acquisition cost\".

This depends on the recovery rate. Let's assume recovery rate is 50%. Thus, credit risk percentage out of total spread is evenly forwarded and 0.25% of the total spread is forwarded to the loss given default rate.\n\nStep 3) Loss Given Default Rate * (Non-defaulted probability) = total spread.\nInterestingly, we saw that 0.25% of the total spread is forwarded to the loss given default rate. We know that the loss given default rate is 60%, thus only the defaulted (1-Non-defaulted probability) part of the bond is affected by the loss given default rate Thus the Non-defaulted probability is 96.08% (100%-3.92%=96.08%) and the Total spread is 4.15% (4.0% + 0.25% * 0.9608).\n\nStep 4), Credit spread = total spread – recovery rate * loss given default rate = 4.15% – (100% – 50%) * 60% = 2.2%.

Then, find the final answer. Please note that, whatever you do with the text using NLP APIs is not helpful (in the suggested methods, you will find how to get the answers). Instead, use common sense and meta-knowledge, such as `straight line depreciation` is used to amortize (\\$1 - \\$1/2*\\$1 = \\$1 \\$). In the end, you should apply your meta-knowledge on the right-most column of the questions to get an answer. For some other questions like the ones used in section 4.2.2.3, there would be several candidate answers. In this case, simply find the correct one.\nWe compare our suggested model against the two baseline systems, T5 and \\textsc{Bot-Embed}. We use the following metrics in the experiments:\n\\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt, itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt, leftmargin=1cm, labelwidth=1cm, align=left]\n\\item Word F1-score: Word overlap measure with \\texttt{Spacy}\\footnote{https://spacy.io/documentation/vector-similarity}.\n\\item Sentence F1-score: Enforce an exact answer whenever possible and lowercasing both systems’ outputs and the target answers.\n\\end{itemize}\nWhile the latter metric is based on enforcing an exact string matching between the ground truth and the bot-generated answer,\nSentence F1 allows for not only higher-order features and inferential skills, but punctuation mark help in distinguishing between multi-word potential answers.\nWe use exactly the same data splits that was used in Prior Work~\\citet{Pham:2021:RCD21-workshop} to analyze the performance of the systems when validating against data used in training and when validating against unseen data. Additionally, we provide another set of results that evaluates system performance for questions with long text in the answers (section 4.3). We provide an error analysis on systems’ failures in identifying credit card processing fees due to the complexity in their calculation (section 4.4)."

As the Tree goes from bottom to up meaning from 0 to T(time), I should do 1.75%*(1+1.5%)^-1 which is like 4.8984%. 100*T(1.75%)*(1+1.5%)^-1. 100*1.04984.\n\nThe expected value is 100*(1+100*1.04984).

At first I tried what I thought was a natural python way to construct a recurrence relation by stacking if-else. However, this code turns out to not complete the task, because it should take care of the previous answer before getting the next one. So I decide to split the whole thing into two parts of recursion and backtracking. Finally, this finally works out with the help of `numpy`, which provides the option for manipulating bits. So, the recursive part read the next digits, and the backtraction part read the previous answers.\n\nComment: I've shown my answer. Feel free to post a valid one if you have.

The standard deviation is irrelevant to the problem.\n\nAnswer: If your sample mean is 22.5 and its variance is 16 and you only take 100 individuals from the community, that gives you a sample variance of 261.3125 (which is 0.15 times the 176 used to derive empirical distribution below.) Standard error is then the square root of the variance which gives 16.090494, which rounds to 16.1.\n\nStandard error for sample mean of $n$ samples from a Normal distribution is the square root of the population variance divided by sample size ($N$):\n\nStandard Error (\\em{SE}) = $\\dfrac{\\sqrt Var(x)}{\\sqrt N}$\n\nVariance = $N\\times Var(x)$\n\nVar of sample mean = $\\dfrac{Var(x)}{\\sqrt N}$\n\nWe can check that this works by estimating the distribution of the sample means.

            " First of all, you need to calculate the investment performance of each portfolio, and the weights of the portfolio and the benchmark. Divide the value added from asset allocation by the weights of each portfolio to get the value added from the portfolio.\n\nBegin with the domestic equities, whose yearly portfolio return is 25%, the benchmark return is 15% that consist 50% of the assets where half of them weigh 35%. To know the domestic equities performance, we need the following equation:\n\n(Portfolio Weight*Performance) - (Benchmark Weight*Benchmark Return)= (50%*25%)-(35%*15%)= (-0.0875 )\n\nSimilarly, the bond's yearly portfolio return is -9% that consist 30% of the assets where half of them weigh 35%. The bond's value added is:\n\n(Portfolio Weight*Performance)-  (Benchmark Weight*Benchmark Return) = (30%*-9%)-(35%*5%)=5.7%\n\nThe international equities yearly portfolio return is 15% that consist of the assets 20% where half of the them weigh 30%.To get the final value, you need to get the value added from each portfolio and divide by its weight. Therefore, your answers are -(0.0875)/(0.5) + 5.7%/(0.5) + 15%/(0.5)=5.1%\n\nComment: I'm a little confused with this question. I don't see how you can answer the question unless you state the structure of the tables you're going to query, the weighting to apply, the performance metrics, etc. I feel there is a missing context but it may be due to my ignorance. I think more people would answer this with that info. At least, that would be my recommendation.\n\nAnswer: I don't see (or understand) why the weight is 0.5 on all these factors? But below is the logic to get an the answer you want. Just apply your logical to fill in the variables, function, and weights. (I side with Thorsten here on this)\n\n\\strong{"

            " The first step is to calculate annual net income since equity is calculated based on net income from the equation.\n\nLet's think step by step to answer the question. The first step is to calculate annual net income since equity is calculated based on net income from the equation. The annual depreciation amount should be added back to the annual net income. The annual loss on sale of equipment amount should also be added back to the annual net income. These adjustments are made because depreciation and loss on sale of equipment are non-cash expenses. Please note that they are recorded in the income statement but depreciation and loss on sale of equipment are unique because they are non-cash expenses (therefore not cash expenses that were spent directly). The increase in the accounts receivable account and the increase in the inventories account are deducted from the annual net income. These adjustments are made because the two accounts are considered assets increasing (by definition, journals made to record asset increases occur on the debit side of accounts so no evidence of cash outflow is shown there). The increase in the accounts payable account is added to annual net income because the accounts payable account is an asset decreasing account as defined (because it is decreasing assets, it is debited in journals and thus an evidence of cash outflow is shown). Therefore, its increase in time should be added back to annual net income.\n\n45.8+18.2+1.6-4.2-5.4-4.5=66\n\nNext step calculate net cash from the operations of current assets. For this calculation only those accounts that appear on the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows need to be used. Those accounts are accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, depreciation, and dividends. A calculation (sum) of these accounts is 90 (5.4+4.5+18.2+58). In the statement of cash flows, the calculation of net cash from operations of current assets becomes 156 (66+90).\n\nNext step, calculate net cash of the operations of current assets through selling of fixed assets. Then, calculate net cash based on the cash flow statement. Debt investment profit investment and revenue lines are included in the calculation (thanks to Al"

Recoverable amount, fair value, identifiable net assets and goodwill can be found in exhibit 3. We further calculate the value of net assets used for impairment test using the formula: fair value of reporting unit - goodwill - recoverable amount. Fair value of reporting unit is $14,800. Recoverable amount of cash-generating unit/reporting unit is $14,900. Goodwill is $520. Using the formula, 14,800 - 14,900 - 520 = 0.

            " First, what is duration?\n\nDuration is the change in a bond's price given a change in interest rates. Therefore, we need to assume a change in interest rates and calculate the change in each bond's price.\nAssume that interest rates have risen by (r). Now, find the change in price for bonds A, B, and C.\nNext, we can find the duration of bonds A, B, and C.\n\nHow to find the modified duration of this bond portfolio?\nUsing the property of sums, the modified duration of the portfolio is the weighted-average duration of the bonds multiplied by the market value of the portfolio:\nThis modified duration can be compared to a target duration or benchmark duration; a portfolio with a modified duration that is too short (or too long) relative to the target may require an adjustment in duration risk. A portfolio that has already experienced rising interest rates will have a current modified duration that is shorter than implied by the actual current composition of the portfolio (a phenomenon known as extension risk), while a portfolio that has already experienced falling interest rates will have a current modified duration that is longer than implied by the actual current composition of the portfolio."

I think this means the rate of interest is applied to the current portfolio. Since the rate is continuously, at each moment in time h the portfolio would have grown a factor F and would be worth 89.32∙F where h is a small & positive time interval. So if \"h\" is 1 year, then 89.32∙F=100, so F=100/89.32≈1.11928, Thus, if the rate were applied to a sum of money continuously, the amount would double in 1.11928 years.

            "\nTake 2012 as the reference year and get the GDP deflator for the economic climate in 2013 for Product X and Y.\nThen, get the cross-price of product X and Y. Because the question asked for product B and we don’t know the unit costing of product B in 2013. Which means, we need to isolate TO get the second defining relationship. But we need the cross price to get TO. It’s like a loop. But only one value matters.\n\nWe need take a GDP Deflator to solve the question. GDP is the market value of goods and services produced. Suppose, there are 100 units of wheat produced with a price of 50. GDP is 5,000(100 units of wheat * 50 = 5,000).  As the price rising up year by year(or the value that we can get from each unit of wheat), the term GDP deflator is becoming popular. Same for GDP Deflator, it is the ratio of Nominal GDP in Current Prices to the Real GDP in Constant Prices(nominal - real), or the GDP deflator.\nThe real GDP in Constant Prices is 5,000 and we can get a nominal GDP in current prices is 10,000. From the table, price is 9 for 100 units wheat(9 for 100 units x 100 is 9) => 900(a nominal value). But how to get the price of 9? From the value of wheat, we can get a cross-price of 900(nominal GDP) / 100 for the original quantity in the market. From multiplied 9 for 100 units wheat(from GDP deflator), the best cross-price of wheat is 900.\nHence, the cross-price of product X and Y in 2013 is unknown.\n\nFrom the above answer, we see 2013 as the reference year and 102.4 as the GDP deflator and unknown cross price of product X and Y, then, how to get the unit cost of item B in "

In this case, as a futures contract can be both bought and sold, the number of futures contracts that are to be sold may be a negative value.\n\\item Thought process ( come up with an answer you think may be correct ) The objective is to reduce the beta of the portfolio from 1.2 to 0.9 over a span of two months. It is proposed that the retirement intend to use a futures contract to achieve this objective. Lets assume this will reduce the beta of the retirement portfolio from the current value of 1.2 to 0.95. This reduction in beta to 0.95 will mean that there will only be a further reduction of only 0.05 in beta after an additional two months has passed. Thus, the total beta reduction after two months has passed is only from 1.2 to 0.95. It can be seen that the total beta reduction of only from 1.2 to 0.95 means that the futures contract is not sufficient to achieve the objective of reducing the beta to 0.9. As the solution is insufficient, it will be required to employ a beneficial solution. If the retirement fund buys a beneficial solution that has a beta of 0.75, then it can be seen that there are two options. There is either a zero futures contract, in which the portfolio's beta reduces from 1.2 to 0.75 after the beneficial option is employed. Or there are -25 futures contracts, where the futures contract is sold, which reduces the portfolio beta by 0.95, thus requiring the beneficial solution to reduce the beta from 0.95 to 0.75. The latter can be seen to be the sub optimal scenario as a negative value in futures contract is required to decrease the performance of the portfolio. Thus, the number of futures contracts can only be zero.\n\\item What you think are the key assumptions\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: One possible answer is just calculate it.\n\n"

In order to change the interest rate, you should multiply the interest rate by a factor. Since 3% knows to change out the maturity days from 360 to 300 days like 3%*[360/300]). so, 0.07 is the same as [3%*360/300]  = [3%*120/100]  = [0.03*120/100] = 3.6%.\nTherefore, the financial institution gains arbitrage profit from money market with 3.6% of the bond equivalent yield.\n\nComment: It seems a pretty weird setting with a 300 day issuance period and the interest rate marked per year.

This interest rate is unknown to you.\n\nThe bond has 300 day until maturity, if we were to compute the nominal rate of return we'd be explicitly told (most likely) but this question is not phrased this way.\n\n\\strong{You'll solve this by back-solving it.}\n\n$100=\\frac{36"

Also, c=coupon rate (after compounding if applicable, such as 4% deferred for 2 years is the same as 8% coupons paid quarterly during whole life to maturity). Note we are calculating actual payments ahead of time. Therefore, we assume cash flows grow at the same pace as the coupon rate in contrast with the effective (true) yield calculation below based on the yield which is constant over time.\nFor example, \\$80×0.04×{[1>(3/4)×0} }{ [1-(3/4)×0]×(1+0.08×0.25)^0}/{(1+0.08×0.25)}\\\\= \\$25 added value to the $80 par value (25/1000×$80=$25)\n\nSecond, we add this value to the current value of the coupon bond ($87.00). $87.00+$25.00=$112.00\n\n\\section{Third, we count the total coupon payment of each year ($n$th year).

            " Since the given yield curve is instantaneous, first, we need to make a 1-year zero coupon yield curve. Following the given swap spread, we can calculate the 1-year bond using the yield curve and spot rate data. Then, we can see that the quitted yield, roughly 3.1%, is an approximate value as the expected yield rate of 1-year bond since the short-term interest rate is relatively high. The expected forward price of the 1-year bond is 0.9730, and IC < EY < VaR = Q1. However, CDS rate is relative to a whole 1 year, but the annual default probability is unknown. Therefore, firstly, we have to make a 3month CDS curve and interpolate it for 1 year. Then, we can calculate the CDS 1-year spread and annual default probability. We also has to take into account that if the assumed CDS spread is too high, the 1-year forward is 0. Then, we can confirm that the forward price of the 1-year bond should be used the upper limit of the expected forward curve since the interest rate is relatively high due to increased investors’ risk sip.\nYour classmates are working on this problem.

The hedge ratio has an inverse relationship with risk, so a hedge ratio of 0 means the hedged position is perfectly correlated and no risk is avoided, while a hedge ratio of -1 means the position is perfectly uncorrelated and risk is completely negated. Most of the time, the hedge ratio lands somewhere in the middle where there is a positive correlation between the hedging asset and the hedged asset.\n\nThe minimum variance hedge ratio is determined by dividing the covariance of the asset being hedged with the asset that is used to hedge by the variance of the hedge asset.\n\n## Usage\nU.S. kids who have taken AP Statistics probably can solve the question.\nYou can reference to [this sample](https://git.io/hiqT6).

For this question, you are supposed to assume that for the given investment property, every Euro stored in the beginning of the year was exchanged for exactly 1 C at the beginning of the year (you assume they are the same here).\n\nTo check our assumption, we actually need to learn the information about Euro (currency) in 2021. We pulled the information from CoinMarketCap: euro to c occupancy rate = 1:1.\n\nFor simplicity here, we could assume on Y1, the firm borrowed exactly 1C from a bank and bought exactly 1E boundaries (therefore, the bank has no USD balance left). Again, we are assuming that the Euro does not change to any other currency like USD and it is only exchanged to C only.\n\nThe exchange rate stays the same all year long. At Y1, the firm bought a plan that was worth 1000E. During the Y1, the value of Euro falls 10% and the value of USD also falls 10%. Via assumption, USD has been converted to the Euro continuously. Now the plan with respect to E costs 900E so the fair value is 900E. However, the firm still has to return the 1000E. We should use a very simple pricing model to justify this:\n\n\\em{1000E - (1000E * (1 - (1 - 0.1)^1)) = 810E = 810C.}\n\nIf the firm borrowed 1000C from the bank at the beginning, it would owe the bank 1000C again at the end (assuming no fluctuations in C), so it will be profitable as it owes less than what it borrowed.\n\nYou will always borrow less than the value of C and you will always have to pay back less than borrowing amount. However, with respect to your initial capital injection, which was 1000C, your plan is worth 810C, which is less than your initial investment.\n\nComparison chart:\n|         | End of the Year ( thousands) (Euro) | End of the Year ( thousands) (with respect to"

            "\nAs we can see from the table, Historical Average Equity return (4.6%) is below current government bond yield (2.3%).\nIt is inferred that the equity risk premium is greater than zero.\nEquity risk premium = Equity expected return − Bond expected return\nEquity expected return = Equity return obtained after adjusting for growth rates in dividend and excess of profits over retained earnings.\n= Risk-free rate (which equals bond expected return, hence 2.3%) + Premium X\nPremium X = future discount factor. It is the equity risk premium component arising from risk factors other than beta. For most securities, this is domestic risk.\nAs we can understand from the given information here, the value of the average government bond yield, the average inflation and the average real earning growth are relatively stable, ignoring the possibility of change.\nTherefore, the calculation of Premium X's theoretical value will be the part where the difference between the expected and present government bond yields is reflected most. The difference between them (0.2) will be used in the calculation of risk-free rate. Thus, the calculation is as follows.\nEquity expected return = 2.3%+2.3%X (X is Premium X coefficient)\nIn this case, Premium X = 0 since change in bond interest rates are assumed to be zero.\nObtaining from: Equity expected return = 4.6%.

If the days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased from 30 days to 28 days, the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is 2.33 (1/30-1/28). Now if Days Sales Outstanding stays the same, from 30 days down to 28, the cost of goods sold must go down. Let’s express that change using percentages. The Days Sales Outstanding is 1/30th of its value. Therefore, the amount must to go down by 1/30th or 12(/.30) percent to go down from 28 days to 28 days. You used a 3:1 ratio, using 3 days of inventory to 1 day of inventory.\n(4) Finally, COS figure went down, in non-percent terms (that’s already in terms of numbers. You want to figure out how much), $1.2 million to $0.35 million. The ratio is 4. The cost of goods sold should be 4x less.

The three investments are port_1, port_2 and port_3. For example, you get the terms 0.12, -0.23, and 0.002 for the three investments.

Then how do we find the value of it from the table?\nLet's find the total cost to make 3 machines by adding total cost to make one, two and three machines in the table:\n(1 inventory unit of machine) + (2 inventory unit of machine) + (3 inventory unit of machine). example total fixed cost: 400+400+400=1200.\nTherefore, the company makes three machines cost $1200.\nNext what do you find in the question \"what is the average fixed cost\"?

Try to solve the following, you may need some help from the tables.\n\nfirst to calculate your average cost, you need to add Total fixed cost + total variable cost, to arrive \"Total cost\" and you need to divide it by \"Quantity\" (No of units) to get your overall average cost.\n\nCan someone please suggest me how I can achieve that?\n\\end{itemize}\n\n[screenshots](https://i.stack.imgur.com/p8jib.png)\n\nI tried to use regex but I am getting calculations errors using the submisson link.\n[enter image description here][1]\n[enter image description here][2]\n"

            "\n\nThe question tells there are 600 ping pong balls in total.\nAlthough it is a dark container, I still can feel I pick up one ping pong ball with the number 1 through 600. We can see this process is like draw a number from 1 to 600.\n\nAgain, I pick up a ball. Do I pick up a ping pong ball with the number 1 through 600? It could be yes, it could be no. If it's marked balls, then the answer is yes. But if it is not a marked ball, it will reduce the amount of total ping pong balls. If there were 600 ping pong balls before I pick up a ball, and now there are 599 ping pong balls, what is the possibility that a ball I pick up is a marked one? We think this problem is similar to the previous one, where we choose one marked ping pong ball from a container that holds ping pong balls number 1 to 599. So according to the previous answer, this should be a value between 1/600 and 1/599.\n\nTherefore, the final answer must be somewhere between 1/600 and 1/599. Furthermore, (1/600)+(1/599)=2/600. Also, 1-(2/600)=598/600. So the final answer, as a percentage, is 598/600.\n\n\\section{Input and Expected Output}\n\n\\strong{Input:} Blank.

The lowercase version (that is equal to `1.05/2+1/2` aka `0.60` you're looking for) is `p = (p^r + q^r)^-r`, which you can validate yourself be Taylor expanding `p^r + q^r = 1 + rp + rq + o(r)` at first order (`p + q = 2` lets you simplify the first order errors `rp + qr`).\n\nOf course, in Python there's no need to write this whole thing out by hand like we did in the old days; just generate a bunch of numbers randomly, then lose the ones in the middle, and see what portion show an increase."

Although above example is quite easy to solve and it is classified as low-complexity question, the answer usually tells us 'how you want your output to look like'. If the answer is a string array, then you have to confirm your output is a string array and build your function output properly.\n\nComment: As you approach this project, focus on deconstructing the large text into little parts.

The Sharpe ratio is calculated by taking the difference between the return on the fund and the return on the 3-month Treasury bill and dividing that difference by the standard deviation of the fund's performance, which quantifies the fund's volatility and risk. The Sharpe ratio measures whether the higher return the fund manager produces is justified by an increase in risk. In other words, the Sharpe ratio measures the risk premium of the manager.

And then they charged the client at the same year at the beginning of the fourth quarter. And the expenses start from the time they started developing the system.

Because the client paid at the beginning of the year 2020. So the client did not cause the firm to make a cash flow in 2019. what they did was charge the client of $10 M. and therefore it went to the receivables.

These Treasury swap rates are determined based on a compilation of broker data - you can see those rates at https://www.theice.com/markets/interest-rate?assettrack=124 . Note that these include a measure of the additional cost of an 'impaired' guarantor on an uncollateralized basis; 'single-name' swaps would typically trade at somewhat lower rates.\n\nIn the absence of adverse selection (i.e., the brokers contributing these rates having biases that are systematically different from the Fed), we can likely assume that this figure should be close to the 5-year Treasury yield. Nonetheless, I have seen this to be somewhere around 0.20% higher or lower in some market conditions with no particular consistency in the directionality."

The formula to answer the question and write a SQL query:\n\n(82400 - 90650) = 90650 - 82400 = 8210\nAccounting profit in the question is 250000. Taxable income in the question is 215000.

Therefore, we must write the following code in a new line of code window.\n\n82,100=30*Taxable Income - (accounting profit (earnings before taxes) -Taxable income)\n82,100=30(215,000- 250,000)\n82,100=30*35,000\n82,100=10,500\n\nTherefore, Taxable income should be 10500 where Initially we have 215000 -  82400 = 132600 at the end of the year and the Initial 90650 -  82400 - 8210 = 70450.\n\nAny hints/helps to answer for the question will be very much appreciated.\n\nComment: So Basically you want to solve the equation?

The two components will converge when `0.075 = 0.025`, when will 7.5% and 2.5% converge? When the CDS contract conveges the bond market. In order to calculate when the two components will converge, you need to calculate the lambda of the CDS (Probability of Default), when the lambda = the spread, the CDS contract conveges the bond.\n\nIn order to calculate the Lambda of a CDS contract, use the CDS credit model. For the formula in the problem, see (b).\n\nThe CDS credit model is defined in equation (a), here `λ is the lambda of the CDS`, `rp is the annual discount rate from T`. In order to calculate lambda, in the credit model, rp is a random variable following the discrete distribution of frequencies of escrow events [a1, a2, ... an] of insurance companies.\n\n`lambda = sum_(unit)=1 to n of a_i / 1 + rp i`\n\nIn order to apply the formula, see (b). First, let's think about how to use the credit model to calculate the answer of the problem. In order to accurately calculate the profit of implementing the basis trade, first, you need to acquire the discourse of the CDS contract that had struck the market price you have observed, and then reflect it to the lambda.\n\nIn the credit model, there are several methods to acquire rp and lambda.

According to your knowledge on loan financing, you can use formula n*P/t = p, where P is a principal amount of loaned money, p the payment per period, t is the number of periods (5), and n is the total number of periods a loan runs, which is found using the number of repayments multiplied by two, to account for principal plus interest.

Then, you can do the calculation above and let's assign the calculated payment back to #math.\n\nIf you have any question about rule(e.g, '#math' or phrasing a) please reach out to support.\n\n## Example Input:\n\n## <h2 style=\"color:black;\">Vehicle Loan</h2>\n<p>Vehicle Loan -&gt; What is the monthly repayment for a customer who buys a car\nwith a loan of  $30000 that is set to be paid off in 5 years with fixed monthly\ninstallments, an annual nominal interest of 8% and interest compounded monthly</p>\n\n## Example Output:\n\n`#math 278.62`\n\n## Note:\nThe number of inputs will be from 0 to 1000 and the length of each input will be from 0 to 1000.\n\nComment: Welcome to SO, fix the ind"

Although they work in the same field, they are not related.\nSo, Laurel will pick the two different assets to create a portfolio.\n\n## Task\n\nDeriving a unique data-set for the question:\nWhat would be the estimated standard deviation assuming equal weightage for both assets?\n\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio comes from the weighted average of the individual securities' standard deviation while the return is the weighted average of the underlying securities' return.\n\nEach security's standard deviation is computed by:\n\nstd = sqrt(var)/mean\n\nvar = sum((return-mean)^2)/N\nmean = sum(return)/N\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n# get mean\nmean = sum(return)/N\n# get std\nvar = sum((return-mean)^2)/N\nstd = sqrt(var)/mean\n\n## Solution\n\n\n## Input file description:\nEach line of the standard input contains a single data-set.\nThe formats are as follows:\nTerm 1 : type:<String>, format:<String>(Argument separator: <Space>)\nTerm 2 : type:<String>, format:<String>(Argument separator: <Space>)\nTerm 3 : type:<String>, format:<String>(Argument separator: <Space>)\nTerm 4 : type:<UInt64>,format:<UInt64>(Argument separator: <Space>)\nTerm 5 : optional data, type:<String"

It does this by initially giving each stock equal weight during the initial start of the index. As the encompassed stocks grow and diminish, the values grow and diminish as well. In fact, keeping the whole thing in equilibrium is just a huge picture of calculating all variables to maintain the same values, resulting in an early seventeen century's watchmaker's experience.\n\nII) Return:\nReturn (or rate of return) (in financial contexts usually abbreviated ROI) is the profit or loss derived from an investment (in relation to the amount of money invested).\n\nIII) Example:\n[<IMAGE>]\n\nAnd the expected answer for input is 6%\nNote that decimal values may be rounded. For example, 14.7324 is displayed as 14.73.\n\nIn the above example, stock Y has much larger weight than others. Therefore, there is a high possibility that return can be higher than the expected value. On the other hand, in an equally-weighted portfolio, a stock that fall drastically can influence overall values.\n\nWhy does the return for an equally-weighted portfolio tend to be higher than those of other portfolios?\n\nThe only difference from chronological return and equally-weighted return is whether you include dividends and distributions in your equally-weighted calculations. Dividends and distributions do have an effect here since they tend to raise stock values and thus raise portfolio return.\n\nBut if you have had or engaged in a position on two given securities of the same value, it is not always the case that the one raising its value can compensate for the other losing its value. Isn't it more balanced to pick one stock and just stick with it regardless of stock's market value, even if it's expensive now? What if markets tank, as they're inclined to do from time to time?\n\nYour task is to calculate a return for an equally-weighted portfolio that consists"

If just want the initial and final Position, we needn’t consider the leverage until the revaluation date:\n\nPosition at end of a half-year: The updated initial equity plus the return is (1+0.5*5 percent)*10,000;200 multiplied by $60 and 1+0.5*5 percent (return) is result in 11.

            " First, you need to get the information about the revenue that the park earned for 1 regular-priced pass and under discounted price namely  :\n\n`MR = 300*50-40*450 = 30,000 - 108,000 = -78,000`\n\nand the constant term can be ignored. So, it means that the marginal revenue gained with the discount equals\n`MR = 50 - 40 = 10`\n\nThen you can incorporate your answer into a sentence form like this:\nThis gave me a better understanding of your question prev mention above. A manager at a snowboarding park is contemplating providing discounts on weekday snowboarding passes. With the regular price being €50 per day, it is anticipated that 300 patrons will purchase passes each weekday. However, if the price is lowered to €40 per day, it is expected that 450 patrons will purchase passes each weekday. What is the marginal revenue per patron gained through providing the discounted price?\n\nSample Answer:\n\nYou can look at this from the point of view of the consumers. You said that the number of consumers increased when the price dropped down. This increased consumption means that the new price provides more value to the average consumer than the old one (therefore it is also called \"consumer surplus\"). However, we also saw that the total amount the companies earned increased, which means that keeping the price despite the lower total consumers would have been a poor trade-off from the company.\nComputing the exact consumer surplus can be somewhat complicated, particularly because consumer behavior is often observed to be non-linear - Only spenders prefer the new price because it has dropped below their cost of pain from spending money.\nFor this, you can use the formula\n\nConsumer surplus = consumer consumption at old price - consumer consumption at new price.\nWe can easily deduce this formula from the version applied to the entire market (ie, consumer surplus is the visible demand at the old price minus the entire demand at the new, lower price). For the answer on your example later next, consumer surplus is 100-50=50 to the left.\n\nNotice that your example does not"

Let’s find its definition.\n<Two rules for finding forward rates and spot rate>\n\nIf you want to know about the definition of the forward rate and spot rate further, please refer to Rules-for-calculating-forward-rate-and-spot-rate-introduction. [1] You will get it quickly.\n\nThe symbol of the forward rate of the four-year period is (4y1y).\nUsing this symbol, let's refer to the formula to find the definition of the forward rate of the four-year period.\nThe formula is as follows.\nNow there is a way to think about it.\nThe formula is composed of two parts. One is 'The forward rate of the four-year period', and the other is 'The formula will tell you the definition of the forward rate of the four-year period'. These two parts are things we know and things we don't know.\nSo you should replace the one with symbols to make them correspond to the ones with numbers.\nThe forward rate of the four-year period is 'Forward Rate (4y1y)', paraphrased as '(4y1y)'. But it is not (4y1y), but 'Forward Rate'. Forward Rate means the sum of '1 + the four-year rate.’ This means, let's replace the formula as well. It becomes '1 + Forward Rate(1y)' 'forwards the one-year rate'. As a result, the formula becomes 'forward rate(4y1y)=1+forward rate(1y)' 'forwards 1 year' 'forwards 1 year'.\nTherefore, the answer is the forward rate of 4.40%.\n\\end{code}\n\nand this my code so far:\n\n\\begin{code}\n    import unittest\n    import question\n\n    class TestQuestion(unittest.TestCase):\n\n        def setUp(self):\n            pass\n\n        @classmethod\n        def setUpClass(cls):\n            pass\n\n        @classmethod\n        def te"

The question is not about the difference between FCFE and FCFF nor about the financial statements of the organization. You don't need to gather information from the financial statements of the organization to answer the question. If you use the financial statements, you will be marked down because you will be off topic. That means you give the answer which the question doesn't require. Just quickly calculate/estimate by yourself.\n\nExplanation: If you are not sure what accounting concepts are used and how to calculate the depreciation, please read the following excel file or the attached pdf file (Calculating Depreciation for M&S)\n\nExplanation: cash concept is the approach in accounting used to compute the value of a fixed asset depreciation expense using the assumption of cash flow considerations. Accounting currency is used to define the units of measurement One concern, however, is how to compute depreciation expenses incurred on fixed assets: How do these fixed assets depreciation expenses affect the firm's real liquidity?\nCash concept There are two methods to compute depreciation expenses. The first is based on \"the cash concept\". Please note, this first method is seldom used in practice because it has now been replaced by the \"income concept.\"\nThis first method involves recording a depreciation charge to current fixed asset account but then offsetting this debit by a credit to a current liability account. In other words, the full recording involves a cash approximation, and as long as the cash cost of depreciation is recorded on the balance sheet, the timing (or period in which this cost is recorded) cannot matter. The fund for paying depreciation expense is already included in the firm. Depreciation is not a term recognition of past cost, so this cash concept has been replaced with an income approach.\nThe second method for computing depreciation expenses is based on \"the income concept\".

You can derive the requested percentage directly from `ProgActMarket` alone. You don't have to calculate `dTimeFactor"

The main trick is to recognize that an expression of the form A/(1-B) is equal to A*B. Hence, the entire term preceding the \"add-on\" is given as: (b*v)*((((((p/g)+1)/(p/g)+1)+1)/...)+ 1)\n\nSince p/g=0.03 and r=0. 12/b is fixed, you can negate the \"heart\" term and then express v in terms of b .

Thank you so much.\n\nAnswer: As the question says, Grand Rapids Titanium Corp sustains an 80% dividend payout ratio due to its restricted growth potential. To check this, you will need to calculate the required and sustainable dividend payout ratio to have two equilibrium points in this GRTE model.Can you please support your answer with the numerical calculations too?

In case of picking one ball in 200 is two times greater than one in 197. The other factor for three balls in 200 generate less than 0.3% of the results than one in 197.

For a company which faces periodic payments to bondholders whose interest rates float, the possibility of an interest rate swap provides an opportunity to control over the debtor cash flow.

            " Volume Discounts -$20,000 should be deducted from the Revenue $500,000. However, the answer output should be 'Therefore the answer is $500,000 - $20,000'.\nAnother example question: What is the total amount of money that this client has paid to BSG?\nYou need to output the answer in your final sentence like 'Therefore, the answer is ...'. The answer should be a numeric value.\nLet's think step by step to answer the question: Volume Discounts -$20,000 should be added to the Cash $450,000 because they should not be deducted as Cost of Goods Sold since the client already paid $450,000 to BSG. Therefore the answer output should be 'Therefore the answer is $450,000 + $20,000'.\n\nOther Scenarios - Line items where cost of goods sold are deducted:\nGoods Received + Goods Shipped - Goods Returned = Cost of Goods Sold.\nThe accrual accounting principles dictate that if a company buys $200,000 of inventory in October and its dialogue and SG&A costs and expenses, it must recognize the cost of goods sold at the time the sales occur. For example: If this $200,000 is turned into $550,000 in revenue at the time that goods are sold in the following month and if buyers return only $100,000 of goods, the company has $550,000 in good received, $450,000 in good shipped, and $100,000 in good return. Therefore, their cost of goods sold is $100,000, since the return directly offsets that. To summarize: Total Sales - Sales Returns = Cost of Goods Sold\n\nComment: Sample data is great, but you also need to _specify the expected result_ for that sample data in your question.

You can try various methods like bag-of-words or apply some preprocessing like TF-IDF. Tradeoff performance with training time/preprocessing needed.\n\nBut since you specify it is only a few answer choices and relatively easy, I would think doing a simple string-similarity check should be enough comparing the text with it under the number and get the highest score.\n\nAnswer: If you need"

Done correctly, marginal revenue should always be much greater than 1: if it is less than 1, then shut down production.\n\nBelow are two suggested alternatives.  The first one should be a favorite of any political type person:\n\n\"Why Jeeves, the actual number at the saturation point is dynamic, based on these and other changing factors making the maximum marginal revenue fluctuate.  Of course, we have assumed that fixed prices always rule but can you not see the possibility that the large number of transactions at the saturation point would limit availability and/or lead to lower costs because of economy of scale?  Similarly, there is a large secondary market for socks and the squeeze imposed by saturation could lead to oscillations in equilibrium and create volatility which would be topped by topsy-turvy events.

January', and 'January 1.' from 'January 1' in ('Jan. 1.', 'January 1.') and checking items of date wil be added a number before 'January 1.' So that I added a simple numeric comparison like <= 2021 and below 'January' and give true if both statements are valid.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor second question: 'What is a cost of an item?' We have been got an answer from the given sentence. It is well described like 'A business acquired machinery for $50,000 on the 1st of January 2009.' So that, I got answer by same method like other questions above.\n\nFrom next third question: 'Depreciation rate?' A description was given below information (answer).\n\nThe company is implementing straight-line depreciation for accounting reasons over a decade, but applying a declining balance method at a rate of 20% for taxation.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item In general, It will be able to use. A regular expression like '((?i:^[^.]+ [.])+) implementing straight-line depreciation for accounting reasons\\s+over\\s+a\\s+decade\\,' can easily be able to get the declining balance method from the sentence to match all words\n'declining balance method' at a rate of 20% for taxation.'\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnd 'a decade' means ten years. Let's think next question. Finally, 'What"

Then we’ll write the following sentence, 'Tier 2 capital consists of ...'.\n\nTier 2 capital consists of retained earnings, undisclosed reserves, goodwill and subordinated debt. Tier 1 capital consists of own fund minus the subordinated debt, which is (V + U + G + D) - D = ((65.6) + (33.5) + (21.3) + (180.0)) - (180.0). There are two steps in solving the question, so this would be in two sentences. First let's our attention to finding the ratio of tier2 capital to tier1 capital. It is (V + U + G + D) - D) / ((65.6) + (33.5) + (21.3) + (180.0)), which equals to 0.535968 (1dp). Therefore, the answer is ...\n\nComment: Remember: there are two types valid capital invoice items 1. issued capital (shares, shares = shareholders' funds * firm expected market price) and 2. promised payment of a fixed capital amount (bonds). When a firm declares dividends and pays these dividends it is cancelling shares in favour of the shareholders. I'm sure you can snowball from there.\n\nComment: If the promissory payments cannot be honoured, then they are reputational offers with no contractual obligation. All liabilities of any kind are reputational offers with no contractual obligation, unless you can by resolution provide otherwise, which means that you can elect to vote to allow your firm pass a resolution restricting the board's ability to indefinitely assume debts and keep on assuming liabilities.

The three questions above are answered as below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Ex-dividend price means the price that John pays to buy more shares after he got $2 dividends each share\n\\item John has 50,000 shares before reinvesting dividends\n\\item The latter three columns illustrate how many share does John have after reinvesting dividends.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHere is the explanation.\n\nJohn has 50,000 shares.

If no dividends are paid, the stock is worth of $7,500,000 (=50,000 *\n$25 * $24)\n.\n\nLet’s assume ex-dividend price $19.6, then John has 144,230.909090909091 shares\n= 50,000/19.6.\n\nJohn reinvest his $2 dividends in shares, then John gains\n144,230.909090909091 x $2 = $288,461.81 dividends which equals $128,461.81 in current value.\nTherefore, the current stock is worth of $7,500,000+$128,461.81 = $762,461.81.\n\nSo, 144,230.909090909091 shares are worth of $7,624,618.1\nwhich equals to\n$3,568,864.24 in future value.\n\nNote"

            "\n1. What is YTM?\nIt is the discount rate that, when used to compute the present value of a bond, equals the bond's expected internal rate of return. Also called yield to call, yield to maturity is expressed as an annual percentage and assumes that all coupon payments will be reinvested at the same rate.\n2. What is the YTM formula?\n\nThe YTM formula is actually derived from the PV calculation with the coupon divided into semi-annual payments:\nPV = bond valuePrice = coupon payment / ((1 + Yield) ^ (years to maturity / 2))For annuities and other terms (i.e. periods other than semi-annual), a full adjustment must be made to the exponent to account for the frequency of the payments.In the case of semiannual payment bonds, the exponent becomes (years to maturity / 2).\n3. How to compute YTM for the given Bond?\n\nAssuming you know the basics behind YTM, here we've estimated price for a bond with semi-annual coupons, purchased at a par value of $100, a coupon rate of 6% paid twice a year, and a period of decade to maturity. Assume that yield is YTM.\n\n1. Payment Periods You have 20 periods of coupon payments because the bond matures in 20 years. Many of our examples have been using payments which occur annually, but in this case, there are twice the payment periods for the bond's semiannual rate.\n\n2. Coupon Payment\n    The semi-annual coupons will be paid in June and December each year, so the coupons are split into equal amounts to make payments twice a year.\nThe coupon rate is at 6% (i.e. 6%/2) so this makes coupon value of $100*0.06/2=$3 per period.\n    It's easy to solve that using the present value of $1, PV, for YTM, if we only had that one value, but recall that we need to combine all of the cash outflows and inflows together. So we'll need to make a number of adjustments before"

You need to get the coupon payment/year and term of the agreement from the question. Note: a year is 365 days.\n\nNow, you need to estimate the 5-year protection due at initiation of the contract. You need to multiply the annual cost of protection amount by 5(as the term of the contract is 5 years).\n\nAfter that, you need to figure out 'how much protection in terms of bps will be received for the 250 Mn EUR* notional at initiation and throughout the 5-year period, provided the credit takes place on that day?' But, always remember that each bp represents \\$25,000 of the total notional. Necessarily you need to divide the 5-year cost of protection in terms of \\$ and this is totally 250,000,000 EUR ($ value) by \\$ 25,000. This means, we are receiving the protection of (=$25,000 * 480) 12,000,000 for the next 5 years. Then, you need to convert it into the yield term, this is the same thing of expressing the \\$ value of protection in terms of bps of the notional. Therefore, you need to express \\$(12,000,000/5)/ \\$25,000 = 150 bps. If default occurs after one year subsequent to initiation of the contract, you need to estimate how much protection you will get on the day of that. In this case, they get \\$17,500,000 protection in dollars (5 times 5-yr cost of protection amount). Therefore, it is (17,500,000/5)/ \\$25,000 = 150 bps on the notional.

By simply googling, we know modified duration is effective duration.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/69BO0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nPerformance formula relationships can be expressed as a linear relationship between percentage P&L and yield change, y%. This linearity is a consequence of the fact that as the yield, y%, changes by one basis point, the price changes by a fixed unit amount, p. This relationship implies that for a small change in yields, the position or portfolio simply “marches” in parallel, and there is no need to compute the curvature of the shifting yield curve.\nConvexity is defined as the second derivative of bond price with respect to interest rate changes. Specifically, it is a measure of the it is sensitivity of the duration measure to the curvature (or slope) of rates. Convexity calculation is quite complex and numerical integration is most typically done.\n\nAnd we also know if the change in interest rates causes a change in bond pricing, this change could be analyzed in 2 ways: in terms of yield changes or price changesWhat is a 'basis point'? It is described as one hundredth of one percentage point. So, '100 basis points' = '1 percentage point'.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume the bond is priced at the same level before and after rate changes. After rate changes, the modified duration increases by 1.5 years per 25bps.\nUnder the same assumptions as above,\nthe investment advisor 's portfolio value changes increase by 1.25bps\n\nThe result is 1.25bps.  （details are omitted here）"

            "\n1) The worth calculation formula is NOI/Cap rate.\nSo, what will be a value of the NOI for each year?\nWhat will be a value of the Cap rate for each year?\n\nWhat is the answer and the reason?\n\n## 13. Concurrency and parallelism with futures and promises\nIn Swift, multithreading is available via Thread objects, but there is a very important caveat to this: Thread objects are designed to be used on a background thread and be completely independent from your main thread (i.e. your main function).\nFor example, if you have a class called Person, you can't create multiple Person objects and create a new thread for each of them for the following two reasons\\:\n1. You'll try to instantiate several Person objects from main [ensureRunsOnMainThread], which is forbidden. \n(Though if you want to do it, you'll have to add your own synchronization mechanism)\n2. By creating a thread for each Person, you'll end up having deep and not easily maintainable code.\nSo, the official design guideline is that we should never do such a thing. Instead, we should use fugures (or callbacks), and let \"threads\" schedule them.\nThe question is how we can find our Person objects which lives on background thread and update their properties without synchronization overhead and without creating separate threads for each person. Or query their status, and other tasks based on scheduling model of threads...\n\nCreated on March 19, 2015\n\n@author: vzborayan\n*/\n\n//Answer: Since we have to create our own background queue each time if we wanted to have more control on the order of the execution. So I think using thread objects will only make our application is more complex and it will have a need for extensive thread synchronization more so than the current implementation.\n\n\n//Question 1\nclass Person {\n    var property1: String = \"Initialized Property1\"\n    var property2: String = \"Initialized Property2\"\n        \n    var _prop1: String = \"initilized _prop1\"\n    var _prop2: String = \"initilized _prop2\"\n    init(prop1 p1: String, prop2 p2: String){\n    _prop1 = p1;"

Next, is the present value of the rent ($3,000$). Finally, is the interest rate, 8%.\n\nWhen do you type these out?\nYou should save date by using Exchangeable image file type (Exif). Exif is a media file format tag that is standardized in ngma for storing meta data about photos, audio and video files. If you use HP, you can obtain exif via HP web search portal.\n\nThen where do you type these out?\nWhen you need to identify the items from a question, you can type them correlatively into a table, but how can you identify the items when a question is too long? For your reference, please see the example of question located on Input/Output Table in Concept.\n\nThen how should you organize these items before typing them out? Bringing the standard format in XBRL will be helpful to input these items. In general, items can be listed from the Item field of XBRL taxonomy. You are recommended to input (in Japanese) the name of entity in Convert - Entity Name for Inputting Standard Data in Concept. For example, in the entity name of US GAAP 2021 Sales Tax and Use Taxes, the keyword 'entity' is input as follows:\n\ninput:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<item>\n<value e:value=\"1\">Entity</value>\n</item>\n\\end{code}\n\noutput:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<item>\n<value e:value=\"1\">〔Working capital guidance〕</value>\n</item>\n\\end{code}\n\n*The step 1 above shows you how to read algorithms and how to type items step by step to help you to answer each algorithm question in your adequate manner. If you correctly follow the steps, you must get the correct and unique answer for each algorithm question. Also, your answer should be at the top position with 100 points. Please note that multiple answers are not recognized as the correct one.

            " First, Serena will use the machine for 1 years, so a part of the amount of $50,000 is consumed in 2017. And then, the next question is, what kind of method to calculate it. Of-course, it is but straight-line by comparing items with others. Finally, straight depreciation should be something like $5,000 in 2 years, so the amount of $45,000 is consumed in 2017 (in other words, the remaining value of this machine is $5,000 in 2017 year end). So, the answer is 45000.\n\nAnswer:\nSerena purchased a machine for $50,000 that has a useful life of ten years and a residual value of $5,000.\nSince the straight-line method is used to calculate the depreciation, we assume in this case that the depreciation will decrease the long-term-asstes value of this machine equally as 20% year by year. By this method, the depreciation of this machine is $5,000 every year.\nTherefore, the answer is 5000.\n\nComment: You are expected to post code and/or data as text, not as an image.\n\nComment: @Serenen I have no other method than using logical wording.. other than any pre written code, can you give me a specific example of this?\n\nComment: While panduan is right that the image should be posted as a text/code segment (code formatting, or [indent 4 spaces] to make it a spoiler, might be enough), I think your issue is mostly related to the \"reasoning\" you seem to be using in your question: It doesn't check a few things, so it's never going to give a \"relevant\" answer.

            " As you see at the end, they have put together 2017 ending and 2016 ending account balances to know what happened between them.  We need to use these four given figures, $300,000, $56,000, $9,000, and $20,000 in some way.\n\nContext\nIn accounting, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. For example, if you cut someone’s hair, that person’s hair gets shorter and your hair gets longer. In accounting, your hair cutting action could change the dollar amounts in your T‐accounts. If you record a cash outflow, you lose cash; and if you record a cash inflow, you gain cash.\nFor a given account, a cash outflow decreases its balance and a cash inflow increases its balance. When you’re working on finance problems, these arrows are crucial. Suppose you’re figuring out what happens to net income as net sales increase; to do that, you’ll have to identify what we call a relevant account. In this situation, net sales are relevant, but net income isn’t (unless you go hog-wild and buy drinks for everyone to celebrate your rising sales). In fact, anytime you’re trying to determine the effect of an increase in sales on another variable, revenue is not a relevant account. Rather, accounts payable and inventory are going to be relevant for this scenario.\nA simple equation you can use should be:\n\n`net sales = accounts receivable − (accounts payable) − inventory + fixed assets`\n\nThis equation shows that if there is an increase in net sales (for example by U$30,000), that difference must come from an increase in accounts receivable or a decreased in accounts payable, or an increase in inventory, or a decrease in fixed assets.\n\nComment: I would suggest that conversation is off-topic for SO, you need to find the programming forum, or wait here and ask for this to be migrated!\n\nComment: @SaiBot The question mentions Java as a programming language. This also appears to be at best a simple math question, at worst a homework question. Either way, it is off-topic.\n\n"
