The program assumes that all the values provided in the table are known and would be used as inputs. The recurrent pension expenses would be the total of the service costs, employer contributions, benefit obligations, plan assets, actual return on assets, and the discounted value of the beginning and ending benefit obligations calculated with the given discount rates. Alternatively, the difference between the discounted value of the beginning and ending benefit obligations, discounted at a different rate, is used to find the recurrent expenses. Note that this calculation, however, does not consider the future value of money and may need adjustment properly if accounting for future values is necessary.\n\nTry running the above function in a python interpreter to get your answer.

The actual calculation is a bit more complex because it depends on other factors such as macroeconomic conditions, interest rate, equity risk premium, term premium etc. And it's not recommended to use bond price to make such estimate due to the traditional wisdom that the higher the bond price is, the higher is the bond return. This strategy typically focuses on investing in lower0 sold-out stocks and AAA rated bonds in the lower tier when market is climbing.\n\nAssuming everything else is held constant, the output of the script will be the effect of the change in bond's yield to return.

When he uses a bankruptcy prediction model, he finds that 70% of these bonds will be deemed as \"good\", suggesting a lower risk of failure.

(Hint, let P(A) be the likelihood of bankruptcy, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" rating, P(B | A) be the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of bankruptcy given a \"good\" rating.)",
