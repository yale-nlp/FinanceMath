This metric is useful for calculating the intrinsic value of equity in a business. It's the cash flow available to a company after capital costs for long-term investments and subtracting any dividends paid out.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the calculation.

We assume no debt issued or paid off during the year as there is no corresponding information provided.\n\n    # return answer\n    return FCFE\n```\n\nThis is a rough estimate and U have not provided some information like weights, cash holdings, and dividend policy.

This will involve calculating the proportion of clients that have a car insurance plan and a house insurance plan, the proportion that have only a car insurance plan, and the proportion that have only a house insurance plan. Then, for each group, calculate the proportion that will renew their plan(s) next year.\n\nHere is the Python program to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    clients_car_only = 0.7    # Proportion of clients with only a car insurance plan\n    clients_house_only = 0.5   # Proportion of clients with only a house insurance plan\n    clients_both = 0.2          # Proportion of clients with both car and house insurance plan\n\n    renewals_car_only = clients_car_only * 0.4  # Proportion of clients with only a car insurance plan that will renew\n    renewals_house_only = clients_house_only * 0.7 # Proportion of clients with only a house insurance plan that will renew\n    renewals_both = clients_both * 0.8  # Proportion of clients with both plans that will renew at least one\n\n    # Calculate total percentage of clients that will renew at least one plan\n    total_renewals = renewals_car_only + renewals_house_only + renewals_both\n\n    return total_renewals\n```\nThe returned value of the `solution()` function will be the total percentage of clients that will renew at least one plan next year."

We need to calculate its worth under the given spot and forward rates.\n\nGiven that we need to write a Python function to solve this, let's implement it as below. This example doesn't include calculations at every year for simplicity. We could add those if necessary.\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables\n    coupon_interest_rate = 10\n    par_value = 1000\n    spot_rate = 6\n    forward_rates = [8, 10]\n    discount_factors = []\n\n    # Calculate discount factors\n    for rate in forward_rates:\n        discount_factor = rate / (100 * (1 + spot_rate / 100))\n        discount_factors.append(discount_factor)\n\n    # Calculate the worth of the bond\n    worth = (par_value * discount_factors[1]) + (coupon_interest_rate * par_value * discount_factors[0] / 100)\n    worth = worth * (not discount_factors[0])\n\n    return worth\n```\n\nIn this program, we calculate the discount factors for each year based on the forward rates, and calculate the future value of the bond's coupon payments and the par value. The total worth of the bond is the sum of the present value of all future coupon payments and the present value of the par value.\n\nThe `discount_factors[0]` will always be false because in the year 0, you will always get the par value. Hence the present value of the par value won't have any discounting which is why it doesn't require a discount factor."

The geometric mean return represents the compounded annual return that would result in the same final value if the return was applied over a three-year period."

            " Sure, here is a Python program that implements the Taylor Rule to calculate the nominal policy rate. The Taylor Rule is an equation that attempts to describe how a central bank would set its nominal interest rate, using output and inflation. In this case, we will use the formula in the folowing way: i = (\u03c0-\u03c0_target)+ai+ag*(y-y_target)+(0.5) where i is the nominal policy rate, a_pi is the weight on inflation deviation (my assumption as there is no data provided), a_y is the weight on output deviation (my assumption as there is no data provided), \u03c0 is the current inflation rate, \u03c0_target is the desired inflation rate, y is the current growth rate and y_target is the targeted growth rate, inflation_rate, inflation_target, growth_rate, and growth_target should be the fed's actual data for inflation and growth to plug into the formula.\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables with assumed values\n    a_pi = 1.5 # for inflation deviation\n    a_y = 0.5 # for output deviation\n    inflation_rate = 3 # current inflation rate\n    inflation_target = 0.02 # desired inflation rate\n    growth_rate = 0.035 # current economic growth rate\n    growth_target = 0.025 # desired economic growth rate\n\n    # Calculate Taylor Rule\n    term1 = inflation_rate - inflation_target\n    term2 = a_pi * term1\n    term3 = growth_rate - growth_target\n    term4 = a_y * term3\n    answer = 0.5 + term2 + term4\n\n    # return nominal policy rate\n    return answer\n```\n\nThe function returns the nominal policy rate according to the Taylor rule. Please note that the calculation may vary depending on the federal bank's decisions and the real situation of the economy. You should replace the assumed values with the actual values of a_pi, a_y, inflation_rate, inflation_target, growth_rate, and growth_target according to the federal Reserve's data."
