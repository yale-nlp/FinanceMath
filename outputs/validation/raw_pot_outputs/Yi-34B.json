Be sure to execute the program and return the result of the program.

For each request, you will be given an Amount and a Date, using the following format... \n\nDate string: \n\nYou should check the date of calculation is between dateA and dateB (when calculating the interest):\n```\n  if (startDate[0]<date[0]<endDate[0])\n  \t#console.log(date[0]<endDate[0]);\n  \tinterestAmt = (date[0]-startDate[0])*varR;\n  if (endDate[0]<date[0]<endDate[1])\n  \t#console.log(date[0]<endDate[1]);\n  \tinterestAmt = (date[0]-startDate[0])*varR + (endDate[1]-endDate[0])*varV;\n  if (date[0]<startDate[0])\n  \t#console.log(date[0]<startDate[0]);\n  \tinterestAmt = 0;\n```\nIf the dtae calculation is betweem dateA and dateB, interestAmt should be (date[0]-startDate[0])*varR\n\nIf the date calculation is betweem dateB and dateC, interestAmt should be (date[0]-startDate[0])*var"

Output is a contract that states to what type the return value must be and imposes a\nreturn type on the function. These contracts exist in the same way as other validators in\nPython. Ex hypothesi, you have a function:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    # return answer\n    return answer\n```\nThat will take as an input a dictionary holding information:\n\n\n```python\n{\n# Insert dictionary bellow\n}\n```\nHere is the definition of the dictionary requested, this should be used to build the dictionary you'd like the function to handle:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"input\": {\n        \"text\": \"This is a Text example\",\n        \"text1\": \"This is a Text example1\"\n    },\n    \"integer\": {\n        \"a\": 1,\n        \"b\": 2\n    },\n    \"string\": {\n        \"c\": \"string example\",\n        \"d\": \"string example1\"\n}\n```\nNow you are supposed to modify the code written to properly answer the questions provided. These questions should be answered by using given input and functions. After submitting your code, you have to run the interpreter to verify your input while pointing to the correct paths of definition for your function.\n\n##### Input or Output is not found.\nIf you did not provide correct input, you will receive following error:\n\n```\n===== Process 18 starting, use q(uit) to quit and r(etry) to retry =====\n[EvaluationError] Since you have not specified an object container"

A typical set of household surveys often includes a question that asks how the financial costs of the vehicle (the costs for fuel, maintenance, repairs, etc.) are divided. Depending on the sample of households, the exact division varies, with approximately 70% of people paying for all such costs.\n\nWe would like to predict the amount of money that a person pays for using the vehicle. Based on an empirical study, we know that, on average, a vehicle costs $5,000 per year (or $416 per month). Additionally, we know that the most important factor that determines a person’s cost for using their vehicle is the person’s income, as shown in the below figure. We want to incorporate this information into our model. In the given model, we may want to ask what the standard deviation of the error may be, once we have built our model and included these effects. This is known as correctly specifying the variance in a regression model.\n\n<img width=\"684\" src=\"images/image9.png\"/>\nNotes: The x-axis is measured in ascending order to show that regressing the cost of owning a car against income is a useful approach.\n\nThe below formula represents this relationship. Specifically, we want to predict the amount of money that a person pays for their car. We know that the independent variable, a person’s income, affects the multiple regression’s variance.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nY = line \\quad representation \\quad of \\quad c + \\alpha + \\beta x\n\\end{align}\n$$\nY is a dependent variable and represents the variables that we want to predict.\n\nIn this scenario, the dependent variable is the amount of money that a person pays for their car. Note that we can label X to be any independent variable that we want Y to depend on. In this case, X represents a person’s income."

Please follow these steps.\n\n1. Create a directory or manually click the 'New directory' (the folder icon at the top right). Then create two new notebooks. One is called SP_ITA and another notebook is called SM_Financial_Modelling.\n\nA complete directory would look like this.\n```\nITA_Financial_Modelling\n\\ ── solutions (For solutions)\n|    └── SM_Financial_Modelling\n├── solutions (For SP_ITA)\n\\── .gitignore\n```\n\nThis is how your GitHub repository should look like.\n```\nITA_Financial_Modelling\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md (For README)\n└── solutions (For two notebooks)\n|    ├─ SP_ITA\n|    └─ SM_Financial_Modelling\n```\n\n2. Then put all the `.ipynb` files in the directory called 'solutions' as you can see below:\n`Assessment/` => `solutions`\n\nWith this arrangement, the only visible notebook on `.ipynb` files is the link to the SP_ITA notebook. Other notebooks (and their chosen solutions) could be hidden from public view.\n\n3. To get the link of the notebook (SP_ITA in this case), simply go the file located with the right side of your screen, right-click on the notebook, and click on \"Copy Link to Notebook\".\n\nWith this arrangement, only one file is visible and accessible to the public (the SP_ITA) (recommended). After the second lecture on using Github is finished, I will' choose' one of the two solutions (SP_ITA and SM_Financial_Modelling) and have it as the _only_ Repository.\n\n### Please follow the steps above to confirm its functionality.\n\n(Also open a blog with the first lectures summary and explain: why only one Repository?)\n\n## 🚀 Learning Objectives\n- Write Python programs\n"

Here we separate each test program by a `Classification` command; however, the testers usually separate each program by a `Henceforth` command. Sometimes they may outline a code block, putting an HTML closing tag `</div>` right before the `Henceforth` command, and sometimes they may attach a `Henceforth` command before your program, while adding a `Next:` command at the end.\n3. Do not modify the selected lines of the `Issue View` window. Please do not touch the default keywords or issue labels, leave them as-is. \n4.

Extensions from R to Python: For each novel code segment that is not directly translatable from R to Python, you may get up to 5 points. The rule is: if you copy and paste R codes directly into Python you will get 0.5 points for each input or output you successfully do, if you do any modifications from the R codes to correctly execute the Python version you will get additional 0.5 points, but If you can find novel solutions for the same purpose you can get 5 points for that segment of the program.\n4.
