The difference between the two is CHF100,000. Therefore, the per unit marginal revenue is CHF100,000/50 units = CHF2,000. Since the marketing leader assesses that the per unit marginal revenue for 200 units is CHF4,000, the per unit marginal revenue for 250 units, which is CHF6,000, is 250 units x CHF6,000 = CHF1,500,000.\n\nThe difference between the per unit marginal revenue of 250 units and 200 units is CHF1,500,000 - CHF4,000 = CHF1,496,000.\n\nTherefore, the per unit marginal revenue attributed to marketing 250 units instead of 200 units is CHF1,496,000.\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    revenue_200_units = 500000\n    revenue_250_units = 600000\n    units_difference = 250 - 200\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    average_revenue_per_unit_200 = revenue_200_units / 200\n    average_revenue_per_unit_250 = revenue_250_units / 250\n    marginal_revenue_difference = (revenue_250_units - revenue_200_units) / units_difference\n    \n    # Calculate the difference in total revenue\n    total_revenue_difference = (revenue_250_units - revenue_200_units)\n    \n    # Calculate the difference in per unit revenue\n    per_unit_marginal_revenue_difference = total_revenue_difference / units_"

            "    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    \n    # return answer\n```\nAnswer: To calculate the cost of a 3-year bond that provides an annual interest payment at a 10% coupon rate, we need to determine the present value of the bond's cash flows. The bond has a face value of $1000 and pays a 10% annual coupon for 3 years. Additionally, we need to discount the face value at the 3-year spot rate.\n\nHere's the Python program to calculate the cost of the bond:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    face_value = 1000\n    annual_coupon_rate = 0.10\n    spot_rates = [0.08, 0.09, 0.095]  # Spot rates for 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years\n    \n    # Calculate the present value of the annual coupon payments\n    present_value_coupons = 0\n    for i in range(3):\n        cash_flow = face_value * annual_coupon_rate\n        present_value_coupons += cash_flow / ((1 + spot_rates[i]) ** (i + 1))\n    \n    # Calculate the present value of the face value\n    present_value_face_value = face_value / ((1 + spot_rates[2]) ** 3)\n    \n    # Calculate the total present value of the bond\n    total_present_value = present_value_coupons + present_value_face_value\n    \n    # return answer\n    return total_present_value\n```\n\nThis program calculates the present value of the bond's annual coupon payments and the face value at the end of the bond's life, using the given spot rates. The sum of these present values gives the total present value of the bond, which represents its cost."

            "    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    \n    # return answer\n```\n```\n\n The answer to the given question is likely to be at lower production levels.\nAnswer: To accurately determine the production level at which the degree of operating leverage (DOL) is likely to be the least, we need to consider the relationship between production levels and DOL. The DOL is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{DOL} = \\frac{\\text{Total Contribution Margin}}{\\text{Total Contribution Margin} - \\text{Fixed Costs}} \\]\n\nGiven that the contribution margin per unit is $20 and the fixed production costs are $500,000, we can derive the DOL at different production levels. The DOL will be minimized at the highest possible production levels, as the contribution margin remains constant while the fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units.\n\nHere is the Python program to calculate the production level at which the DOL is likely to be the least:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    unit_contribution_margin = 20\n    fixed_production_costs = 500000\n    \n    # Calculate the degree of operating leverage (DOL)\n    # We need to find the production level where DOL is minimized\n    # Given that the DOL is minimized at higher production levels\n    \n    # Assuming we want to find the DOL for a very high production level\n    # For simplicity, let's assume a very high production level (greater than 300,000 units)\n    production_level = 500000  # Assuming a high production level\n    \n    total_contribution_margin = production_level * unit_contribution_margin\n    dol = total_contribution_margin / (total_contribution_margin - fixed_production_costs)\n    \n    # return answer\n    return dol\n```\n\nThis program calculates the degree of operating leverage (DOL) for a very high production level (greater than 300,000 units), which is likely to be the least since the DOL will be minimized at higher production levels."

Of the bonds that went bankrupt, only 50% were rated as \"good\". Use Bayes' formula to estimate the likelihood of going bankrupt bearing a \"good\" rating. (Hint, let P(A) be the likelihood of bankruptcy, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" rating, P(B | A) be the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of bankruptcy given a \"good\" rating.)",

We are given:\n\n- The probability of a bond going bankrupt is 20%.\n- The probability of a bond being deemed \"good\" given that it has gone bankrupt is 50%.\n- The probability of a bond being \"good\" without any information about bankruptcy is 70%.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the desired probability as follows:\n\n\\[ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of bankruptcy (20% or 0.2).\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of a \"good\" rating.\n- \\( P(B | A) \\) is the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy (50% or 0.5).\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\( P(B) \\), the probability of a \"good\" rating:\n- The probability of a bond being \"good\" without bankruptcy is 70% or 0.7.\n- The probability of a bond going bankrupt and being \"good\" is \\( 0.2 \\times 0.5 = 0.1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(B) \\) is:\n\\[ P(B) = 0.7 + 0.1 = 0.8 \\]\n\nNow, we can apply Bayes' theorem:\n\\[ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 0.2}{0.8} = \\frac{0.1}{0.8} = 0.125 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of a bond having a \"good\" rating given that it has gone bankrupt is 12.5%.\n\nHere is the Python program to calculate this:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    p_a = 0.2  # Probability of bankruptcy\n    p_b_given_a = 0.5 "

        "question": "Lillian, who is the portfolio manager for BC pension, has recently been considering the inclusion of QX Corp. (New York Stock Exchange:  QX) to her portfolio. After a thorough analysis of the company and its competitors, she is of the opinion that the company will witness exceptional growth for the next 4 years followed by normal growth. Therefore, she concludes that a two-stage DDM is the most suitable for assessing the stock's value. In 2017, the total dividends QX Corp. paid was $0.22. She anticipates a growth rate of 12 percent for the upcoming 4 years and 6 percent thereafter. The required return is projected to be 9 percent. What would be the terminal value of the stock according to this method?",
