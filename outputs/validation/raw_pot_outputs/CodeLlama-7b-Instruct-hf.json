These licenses were estimated to possess an economic lifespan of five years. The value of Snowflake's assets and liabilities, excluding licenses, were equivalent to their documented book value. Clearwater and Snowflake's summarized income statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, and Balance Sheet are presented in the subsequent table: Assuming that both companies' 2019 figures mirror those of 2018 and Clearwater has command over Snowflake, what would be Clearwater’s consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for 2019?",
