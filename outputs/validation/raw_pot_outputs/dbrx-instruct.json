Therefore, net income for 2017 is:\n\n   $125 million - $110 million = $15 million\n\n2. Calculate change in accounts receivable: We know that accounts receivable at the end of 2017 is $48 million and in 2016 it was $45 million. Therefore, the change in accounts receivable is:\n\n   $45 million - $48 million = -$3 million\n\n3. Calculate change in inventory: We know that inventory at the end of 2017 is $20 million and in 2016 it was $24 million. Therefore, the change in inventory is:\n\n   $24 million - $20 million = -$4 million\n\n4. Calculate change in accounts payable: We know that accounts payable at the end of 2017 is $33 million and"

This is done by dividing the COGS for the current year ($9,000) by the sales for the current year ($12,000).\n2. Calculate the average inventory by adding the inventory for the current year ($1,200) and the previous year ($1,000) and dividing by 2.\n3. Calculate the payables turnover by dividing the sales for the current year ($12,000) by the accounts payable for the current year ($600).\n4. Calculate the days of payables by dividing 365 by the payables turnover.\n5. Calculate the days of inventory outstanding (DIO) by multiplying the average inventory ($1,100) by 365 and dividing by the COGS for the current year ($9,000).\n6. Calculate the CCC by adding the DIO (49.454545454545455) and the days of payables (20) and subtracting the days of payables (20) again.\n\nThe resulting CCC is 49.45 days, which means that it takes the company an average of 49.45 days to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales."
