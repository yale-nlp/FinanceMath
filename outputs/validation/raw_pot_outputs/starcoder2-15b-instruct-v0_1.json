A price elasticity of 1.8 indicates that demand is relatively elastic, meaning that a small change in price will result in a larger change in demand.\n\nThe marginal cost is the change in total cost that results from increasing the quantity of output by one unit. In this case, the marginal cost is $30, which is the cost of producing one additional unit. The average cost is the total cost per unit of output. In this case, the average cost is $50, which is the total cost of producing 100 units divided by 100.\n\nTo calculate the most probable price, we can use the formula forprice elasticity of demand:\n\n```\nprice_elasticity_of_demand = (% change in quantity) / (% change in price)\n```\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for the most probable price:\n\n```\nprice = average_cost / (price_elasticity_of_demand - 1)\n```\n\nIn this case, the most probable price is $27.78. This is calculated by dividing the average cost ($50) by the price elasticity of demand (1.8) minus 1."

            "To answer this question, you need to first calculate the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for each year, then calculate the free cash flow to equity (FCFE) by subtracting the capital expenditures and equity issuance from FCFF. You can use the cash flow statement and the balance sheet to calculate FCFF and FCFE.\n\nTo calculate FCFF, you can start by calculating the operating cash flow for each year. The operating cash flow is the cash flow from operating activities, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from the total revenue.\n\nTo calculate the FCFF, you need to adjust the operating cash flow for non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and add back non-cash income, such as interest and taxes.\n\nTo calculate the FCFE, you need to subtract the capital expenditures and equity issuance from the FCFF. The capital expenditures are the cash outflows for the acquisition of new products, plants, and equipment. The equity issuance is the cash inflows from the issuance of new shares of stock.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the FCFF and FCFE for Holt Corporation using Python:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    revenue = 3323000\n    cost_of_goods_sold = 1287000\n    sga_expenses = 858000\n    depreciation_expense = 270000\n    operating_cash_flow = revenue - cost_of_goods_sold\n    noncash_income = 1178000 - operating_cash_flow\n    noncash_expenses = depreciation_expense\n    fcff_2008 = operating_cash_flow + noncash_income - noncash_expenses\n    fcff_2007 = 1085000\n    fcfe_2008 = fcff_2008\n    fcfe_2007 = fcff_2007\n    return fcfe_2008\n```"

The `revenue` variable is assigned the value `600000`, and the `avg_account_receivable` variable is assigned the value `50000`. The program then calculates the DSO using the formula `365 / (revenue / avg_account_receivable)` and assigns the result to the `answer` variable. Finally, the program returns the value of the `answer` variable as the answer to the question.\n\nYou can validate this function with a few test cases to ensure correctness:\n```python\nassert solution() == 7.2\n```"
