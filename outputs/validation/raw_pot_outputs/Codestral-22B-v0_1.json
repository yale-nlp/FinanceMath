Using the FIFO method, we first calculate the cost of goods sold in October, considering all 10,000 units were sold in the same month. Then, we determine the remaining units after October sales and calculate the cost of goods sold in November using these remaining units. Finally, we sum the costs of goods sold in October and November to get the total cost of goods sold for 2009. In this case, Shine's cost of goods sold for 2009 is £110,000."

This program calculates the cost per $100 of par value for a zero-coupon bond with a maturity of 15 years, given a yearly market discount rate of 4.5% and assuming yearly compound interest. The formula used is the price of a zero-coupon bond, which is the sum of the present value of all future cash flows, divided by the par value. Since this is a zero-coupon bond, there are no future cash flows except the final par value. The present value of the final cash flow is discounted using the formula for the present value of a future cash flow with compound interest."

It then calculates the price of the four-year bond using its par and spot rates. After that, it calculates the price of the five-year bond, assuming that its price equals the price of the four-year bond (as bond prices decrease as yield increases). With these prices, it then computes the five-year spot rate, which is the difference in price from par divided by 100 (as bond prices are quoted as a percent of par). The program outputs this five-year spot rate, which is 0.03455 or 3.455%."

This value is then returned by the function.\n\nWhen you run the function, you can retrieve the adjusted increase in net income by calling `solution()`.

If the accumulated amortization exceeds the license cost, it is set to the full license cost.\n\nI will now execute the code to get the answer.\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    license_cost = 6500\n    years_of_benefit = 3\n    years_of_amortization = 4\n\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    annual_amortization = license_cost / years_of_amortization\n    accumulated_amortization_at_year_2 = annual_amortization * 2\n\n    # Check if the whole license cost is amortized over three years of benefit\n    if accumulated_amortization_at_year_2 > license_cost:\n        accumulated_amortization_at_year_2 = license_cost\n\n    # return answer\n    return accumulated_amortization_at_year_2\n\nsolution()\n```"
