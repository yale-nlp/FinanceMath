The modified duration indicates the approximate percentage change in the price of a bond for a given change in the yield to maturity (YTM). In this case, the modified duration is 10.3829.\n2. The modified convexity measures how fast the duration changes with the YTM. A higher modified convexity means that the bond's price is more sensitive to changes in the YTM. In this case, the modified convexity is 141.217.\n3. Given the modified duration and modified convexity, we can calculate the price alteration as follows:\n\t* Price alteration = modified duration × modified convexity × yield change\n\t* Yield change = -0.0005 (since the yield to maturity falls by 50 bps, which is -0.50%)\n\t* Price alteration = 10.3829 × 141.217 × -0.0005 = -0.5206\n\t* The projected percentage price alteration for the bond is -0.5206%\n4. The result should be reported as a negative percentage.\n5. The code provided in the previous responses doesn't include the necessary math or variables to answer the question.
