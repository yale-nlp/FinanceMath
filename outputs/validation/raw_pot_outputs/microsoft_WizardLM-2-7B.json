The standard deviation of standard normal distribution (z-distribution) for 36 months (3 years) needs to be used for the test statistic in a one-sample z-test. The z-score can be calculated as follows:\n\nZ = (X - μ) / σ\n\nwhere:\n- X is the value of the observed variable (in this case, the standard deviation of returns),\n- μ is the population mean (in this case, 5.0% or 0.05 as a target standard deviation),\n- σ is the population standard deviation (in this case, 4.9% or 0.049).\n\nSince we want to compare the observed standard deviation (X) to a target standard deviation (μ) that is less than our observed value (we want to show that the actual standard deviation is below 5.0%), we'll calculate the z-score in a way that emphasizes that:\n\nZ = (μ - X) / σ\n\nHere is the corrected and complete Python program:\n```python\nfrom math import sqrt\n\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    sigma = 4.9 / 100  # observed standard deviation as a decimal (4.9% = 0.049)\n    mu = 5.0 / 100  # target standard deviation as a decimal (5.0% = 0.05)\n    n = 36  # number of months\n    \n    # Calculate the z-score (test statistic for a one-sample z-test)\n    test_statistic = (mu - sigma) / (sigma / sqrt(n))\n    \n    #"

It's also important to note that FCFE can be influenced by changes in inventory, receivables, payables, etc., and this calculation does not account for changes in the composition of assets and liabilities beyond working capital.

The retention rate should be used in the ROE (Return on Equity) calculation, but it is used in the sust_growth calculation instead. Here is the corrected Python program:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    net_profit_margin = 0.20\n    retention_rate = 0.60\n    asset_turnover = 0.8\n    financial_leverage_multiplier = 1.5\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get ROE\n    ROE = net_profit_margin / (1 - retention_rate)\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get sust_growth\n    sust_growth = ROE * asset_turnover * financial_leverage_multiplier\n    \n    # return answer\n    return sust_growth\n\n# Call the solution function and print the result\nsust_growth = solution()\nprint(f\"The sustainable growth rate is: {sust_growth * 100:.2f}%\")\n```\nNow, the Python program correctly calculates the sustainable growth rate. However, I've noticed that in the initial problem statement and the final answer, the growth rate is represented as a percentage. Typically, the sustainable growth rate is a decimal (not a percentage), so the final print statement should reflect this. Here is the final Python program:\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    net_profit_margin = 0.20\n    retention_"

Based on this information, what would Firm B’s return on equity be using year-end equity with the ending shareholders’ equity being £10,000,000, a tax rate of 25%, £0.00 in dividends, and a net income of £750,000?",

        "question": "A financial expert predicts that 20% of high-risk bonds will go bankrupt. When he uses a bankruptcy prediction model, he finds that 70% of these bonds will be deemed as \"good\", suggesting a lower risk of failure. Of the bonds that went bankrupt, only 50% were rated as \"good\". Use Bayes' formula to estimate the likelihood of going bankrupt bearing a \"good\" rating. (Hint, let P(A) be the likelihood of bankruptcy, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" rating, P(B | A) be the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of bankruptcy given a \"good\" rating.)",

Note that I've assumed that `solution_returns` is a dictionary with the same structure as `benchmark_returns` and `fund_weights`. If the actual returns for the fund are different from the benchmark returns, you need to define `solution_returns` accordingly. If there's no active management and the fund replicates the benchmark, `solution_returns` would be the same as `benchmark_returns`. However, from the code structure, it seems you're expecting active management, so `solution_returns` should reflect the actual performance of the Kurok Fund's stocks. If `solution_returns` is not provided in your dataset, you need to calculate it or correct the program to use `benchmark_returns` instead for the fund's returns calculation.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or clarification."

The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues. Based off the definition of RAROC, what would Johnson's prediction about RAROC be?",

In this case, the number of outcomes is 3, so we divide by 3 - 1 = 2. The variance is then multiplied by the total probability to account for the fact that the probabilities are not uniform."

The after-tax cost of debt is the interest rate times (1 - tax rate), because the interest payment is tax-deductible. The after-tax cost of equity is the cost of equity times the beta. Since debt financing is superior to equity financing in terms of tax benefits, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) calculation accounts for this by using the formula:\n\nWACC = (E/V) * Re * (1 - T) + (D/V) * Rd * (1 - T) / (1 - T)\n\nWhere:\n- E is the market value of equity\n- Re is the cost of equity\n- D is the market value of debt\n- Rd is the after-tax cost of debt\n- T is the corporate tax rate\n- V is the total market value of the company (E + D)\n\nBy rearranging the terms and solving for the asset beta, we get:\n\nAsset beta = (Rd / Re) * (1 - T) / [(Rd / Re) * (1 - T) + (E/V) * 1]\n\nGiven that the company is 60% financed by debt, we have D/V = 0.60. We can plug this into the formula and solve for asset beta.\n\nNow, let's write the Python program to calculate the asset beta using the provided values:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n"
