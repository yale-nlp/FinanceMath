In this case, the price elasticity of demand is 1.8, which means that for every 1% increase in price, the quantity demanded decreases by 1.8%.\n\nStep 3: Consider the impact of marginal cost\nSince marginal cost is $30, it means that the cost of producing one additional unit of the product is $30. To ensure profitability, the price should be higher than the marginal cost.\n\nStep 4: Consider the impact of average cost\nThe average cost is $50, which is higher than the marginal cost. While the marginal cost ensures short-term profitability, the average cost should be considered for long-term profitability.\n\nStep 5: Use price elasticity of demand to find the optimal price\nTo find the optimal price, we need to consider the price elasticity of demand. If the price is set too high, the quantity demanded will decrease significantly, and the total revenue may actually decrease. If the price is set too low, the quantity demanded will increase, but the total revenue may again decrease due to the lower price.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the given information\nUnfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of the optimal price.

Plugging in the values we know:\n\n    Present value = $1.5 / (1 + 0.05)^6\n\n6. Calculating the present value:\n\n    Present value = $1.5 / (1.05)^6 = $9.56\n\n7. Therefore, the bond's price or value is $9.56.\n\nThe answer is: the bond's price or value is $9.56.\n\n"

The discount rate is the risk-free rate, which is 5% or 0.05. So,\n\n   Present Value = (400 / (1 + 0.05))\n   Present Value = (400 / (1.05))\n   Present Value = $380.95\n\n2.

We need to evaluate an assertion that the investment strategy for this portfolio yields a standard deviation of monthly returns below 5.0%. Our task is to find the test statistic's value.\n\nStep 2: Identify the appropriate test\nSince we are only interested in whether the standard deviation is below 5.0%, we can use a one-sample t-test. In this case, the null hypothesis (H0) is that the true standard deviation is equal to 5.0%, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the true standard deviation is less than 5.0%.\n\nStep 3: Gather the relevant information\nThe sample mean (x̄) is not given in the question, but it is not needed for this test. We have the sample standard deviation (s) which is 4.9%. The sample size (n) is 36.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the t-score\nWe will use the formula for the t-score:\n\nt = (sample standard deviation / (sample size ^ (1/2))) / (sample standard deviation / (sample size - 1))\n\nSince we are only interested in whether the standard deviation is below 5.0%, we can use a one-tailed t-test with 35 degrees of freedom (see t-distribution table).

From these, there are 200 delayed secondary quality loans and 48 delayed top quality loans. We are asked to find the odds that if we pick a loan that is currently delayed, it is a secondary quality loan.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of delayed loans.\nWe know that there are 200 delayed secondary quality loans and 48 delayed top quality loans. So, there are a total of 200 + 48 = 248 loans that are currently delayed.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of top quality loans that are not currently delayed.\nWe know that there are 600 top quality loans and 48 of them are delayed. So, there are 600 - 48 = 552 top quality loans that are not currently delayed.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability that a picked loan is a delayed top quality loan.\nWe can find this probability by dividing the number of delayed top quality loans by the total number of delayed loans. So, the probability is 48/248 = 16/82.\n\nStep 5: Find the probability that a picked loan is a secondary quality loan.\nSince there are only two types of loans in the collection, we can find this probability by subtracting the probability that the picked loan is a delayed top quality loan from 1. So, the probability is 1 - (16/82) = 66/82.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the odds that the picked loan is a secondary quality loan if it is currently delayed.\nWe can find this by dividing the probability that the picked loan is a secondary quality loan by the probability that the picked loan is a delayed top quality loan. So, the odds are (66/82) / (16/82) = 4/1.\n\nSo, the rewritten answer is: There is a 4 to 1 chance that a loan that is currently delayed is a secondary quality loan.\n\nThe answer is: \\frac{66}{82} \\times \\frac"

            "\n\nStep 1: Calculate the discount rate (k) of the shares. Since the dividend is expected to grow at a rate of 10% indefinitely, we can use the Gordon Growth Model to calculate the discount rate:\n\nk = D1 / P0 + g\n\nwhere:\nk = discount rate\nD1 = expected dividend in the first year ($0.32)\nP0 = current share price ($14.69)\ng = dividend growth rate (0.10)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nk = 0.32 / 14.69 + 0.10\nk ≈ 0.0218 + 0.10\nk ≈ 0.1218\n\nSo, the discount rate (k) is approximately 0.1218 or 12.18%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the flotation cost (F) per share. We are given that the flotation cost is 5.0%. We can represent this percentage as a decimal:\n\nF = 0.05\n\nStep 3: Calculate the firm's cost of external equity (Ce). We need to discount the flotation cost by the dividend growth rate:\n\nCe = F / (k - g)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nCe = 0.05 / (0.1218 - 0.10)\nCe = 0.05 / 0.0218\nCe ≈ 2.27\n\nTherefore, the firm's cost of external equity is approximately 2.27%.\n\nThe answer is: the firm's cost of external equity (%) is approximately 2.27.\n\n"

We need to find the price (P) that the corporation is likely to set.\n\nStep 2: Use the formula for price elasticity of demand\nThe formula for price elasticity of demand is:\n\nEd = (∆Q/∆P) * (P/Q)\n\nWhere Ed is the price elasticity of demand, ∆Q is the change in quantity demanded, ∆P is the change in price, P is the price, and Q is the quantity demanded.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values and solve for P\nWe are given Ed (1.5), MC ($40), and AC ($70). Let's first find the relationship between MC and AC.\n\nMC is the cost of producing one more unit of the product, while AC is the total cost divided by the total quantity produced. To find the quantity produced (Q), we can use the following equation:\n\nQ = AC / MC\n\nPlugging in the given values for AC and MC, we get:\n\nQ = $70 / $40 = 1.75\n\nNow, we can use the formula for price elasticity of demand and solve for P:\n\n1.5 = (∆Q/∆P) * (P/Q)\n\nLet's assume a 1% change in quantity demanded (∆Q = 0.01Q) and a 1% change in price (∆P = 0.01P). This gives us:\n\n1.5 = (0.01 * 1.75) / (0.01 * P)\n\nNow, we can solve for P:\n\n1.5 = 0.0175 / 0.01P\n\nRearranging the equation:\n\nP = 0.0175 / 0.01\n\nP ≈ 1.75\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nBased on our calculations, Omega Petroleum Corp. is likely to set a price of approximately"

So, 1.50% * $750 = $11.25.\n3. Now, we need to calculate the total risk-free return. This is the sum of the price return and the roll return. So, $60,000 + $11.25 = $60,011.25.\n4.

The formula for Macaulay Duration is:\n\nMacaulay Duration = Modified Duration / (1 + Yield to Maturity)\n\nFor each bond, we will use the Modified Duration from the table and make an assumption about the Yield to Maturity (YTM). Since we don't have the YTM explicitly provided, we can use the coupon rate as a proxy. This assumption may not be entirely accurate, but it should give us a reasonable estimate of the Macaulay Duration.\n\nBond 1:\nMacaulay Duration = 7.9 / (1 + 0.08) = 7.9 / 1.08 ≈ 7.31 years\n\nBond 2:\nMacaulay Duration = 8.5 / (1 + 0.07) = 8.5 / 1.07 ≈ 7.94 years\n\nBond 3:\nMacaulay Duration = 6.3 / (1 + 0.05) = 6.3 / 1.05 ≈ 5.91 years\n\nBond 4:\nMacaulay Duration = 10.2 / (1 + 0.0) = 10.2 / 1.00 ≈ 10.20 years\n\nStep 3: Calculate the PV01 for each bond\nWe will use the following formula:\n\nPV01 = (Macaulay Duration * (1 + Coupon Rate)) / Price\n\nFor each bond, we will use the Macaulay Duration calculated in Step "

We need to find the projected percentage price alteration for the bond if the yield to maturity falls by 50 bps.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for price change\nThe formula for finding the price change of a bond using modified duration and convexity is:\n\nPrice change = (Modified Duration * Yield change) + (0.5 * Modified Convexity * Yield change^2)\n\nStep 3: Identify the given values\nIn this problem, we have:\n\nModified Duration (MD) = 10.3829\nModified Convexity (MC) = 141.217\nYield change = -0.50% (since the yield to maturity falls by 50 bps)\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values into the formula\nNow, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPrice change = (10.3829 * -0.50) + (0.5 * 141.217 * (-0.50)^2)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the price change\nFirst, calculate the individual terms:\n\n10.3829 * -0.50 = -5.1915\n\n0.5 * 141.217 * (-0.50)^2 = 0.5 * 141.217 * 0.25 = 35.3044\n\nNow, add the two terms to find the price change:\n\nPrice change = -5.1915 + 35.3044 = 30.1129\n\nStep 6: Interpret the result\nThe projected percentage price alteration for the bond should the yield to maturity fall by 50 bps is approximately 30.11%.\n\nIn conclusion, the projected percentage price change for the bond is approximately 30.11% if the yield to maturity falls by 50 bps.\n\n"

Therefore, she considers the Core EPS to be a more accurate representation of the company's earnings.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the trailing P/E using the Core EPS.\nP/E (Price/Earnings) ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the earnings per share. However, we need to adjust the number of shares outstanding to account for the dilution caused by employee stock options. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of fully diluted shares: 200,000 shares + 10,000 dilutive shares = 210,000 shares\n\nNext, let's calculate the Core EPS per fully diluted share: $1.31 / 210,000 shares = $0.0062\n\nNow, we can calculate the trailing P/E using the Core EPS:\nP/E = (Stock price) / (Core EPS per fully diluted share)\nP/E = ($22.00) / ($0.0062) = 3,548.39\n\nThe answer is: 3,548.39.\n\nThe answer is: 3,548.39.\n\n"

            "\n\nStep 1: Identify the necessary inputs from the table to use the Grinold-Kroner model. The model uses the following factors: dividend price yield, real earnings growth, and the expected change in the price-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nStep 2: Find the dividend price yield. This is calculated as the expected annual income return (2.4%) divided by the current equity market P/E (14.5x). For example, if a stock has a P/E of 14.5x and an expected annual income return of 2.4%, its dividend price yield would be 2.4/14.5 = 0.166. However, the table does not provide the current equity market P/E, only the expected equity market P/E. Therefore, we will assume that the current equity market P/E is also 14.0x.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the dividend price yield. Using the assumed current equity market P/E of 14.0x, the dividend price yield would be 2.4/14.0 = 0.171.\n\nStep 4: Determine the expected change in the P/E ratio. This is the difference between the expected equity market P/E (14.0x) and the current equity market P/E (14.5x). In this case, the expected change in the P/E ratio is -0.5.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the annual real earnings growth rate. This is the expected annual real earnings growth (5.0%) minus the expected annual inflation (2.3%). So, the annual real earnings growth rate is 5.0 - 2.3 = 2.7%.\n\nStep 6: Apply the Grinold-Kroner model formula:\n\nAnnual Equity Return = Dividend Price Yield + Annual Real Earnings Growth + (Expected Change in P/E Ratio / 2)\n\nStep 7: Plug in the values we found:\n\nAnnual Equity Return = 0.171 + 2.7 + (-0.5/2)\nAnnual Equity Return ="

The effective annual return is given as 9%.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key information\nThe key information we need to know is the frequency of the effective annual return. This is because the bond-equivalent yield is generally calculated on a semi-annual basis.\n\nStep 3: Make an assumption about the frequency of the effective annual return\nSince the question does not provide the frequency of the effective annual return, let's assume it is calculated on a semi-annual basis. This means that the 9% return is paid twice a year.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the bond-equivalent yield\nNow, we can calculate the bond-equivalent yield using the following formula:\n\nBond-equivalent yield = (Effective annual return / Number of payments per year) ^ (Number of payments per year)\n\nSince we are assuming that the effective annual return is paid semi-annually, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nBond-equivalent yield = (9% / 2) ^ 2\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation\nFirst, we need to divide the 9% by 2:\n\nBond-equivalent yield = (4.5%) ^ 2\n\nNow, we can calculate the square of 4.5%:\n\nBond-equivalent yield = 0.045 * 0.045\n\nStep 6: Calculate the final answer\nFinally, we multiply 0.045 by 0.045 to get the bond-equivalent yield:\n\nBond-equivalent yield = 0.002\n\nSo, on a bond-equivalent basis, the return would be 0.002 or 0.2%.\n\nIn conclusion, the bond-equivalent yield of the investment is 0.2%. The final answer is: 0.2.\n\nThe answer is: on a bond-equivalent basis, the return would be 0.002 or 0.2%.\n\n"

The given information are the growth rates of labor input, labor productivity, inflation, and dividend yield, as well as the P/E growth.\n\nStep 2: Identify the formula\nTo find the continuously compounded long-term US equity returns, we can use the following formula:\n\nLong-term US equity returns = (dividend yield + growth in labor productivity) / (1 + inflation) - growth in labor input\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values\nNow, let's plug in the given values into the formula:\n\nDividend yield = 2.25%\nGrowth in labor productivity = 1.5%\nInflation = 2.1%\nGrowth in labor input = 0.9%\n\nStep 4: Calculate the equity returns\nWe need to convert the percentages into decimals.

So, the new equity allocation is $60 million.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the difference in equity allocation\nSince we've already made a profit, we subtract the investment amount from the selling amount. In this case, we have already made a profit of $20 million (80% - 60%). So, the difference in equity allocation is $20.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of stock index futures\nWe gain exposure to the stock index by investing $1 in futures for every $250 in stocks.

Next, we need to calculate the annual depreciation for accounting purposes. This is done by dividing the depreciable amount by the remaining life of the asset. So, the annual depreciation for accounting purposes is £8,800 (depreciable amount) / 20 years (remaining life) = £440 per year.\n\n3. We then calculate the annual depreciation for tax purposes. This remains the same as the previous year, which is £3,000 per year. This is because the tax authorities do not recognize the revaluation of the asset.\n\n4. Now, we need to calculate the difference between the annual depreciation for accounting purposes and tax purposes.

In this case, we can assume the discount rate to be around 5%. So, interest cost = 45,000 * 5% = 2,250.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the service cost. The company's contribution is 1,200, and since the plan's objective is to have the cost of funding the pension plans match the benefits granted to workers, the service cost is the same as the company's contributions. Therefore, service cost = 1,200.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the growth in the PBO\nThe difference between the projected benefit obligation at the end of the year and the start of the year indicates the growth in the PBO. So, growth in PBO = PBO at the start of the year - PBO at the end of the year = 45,000 - 43,500 = 1,500.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the decrease in the plan's assets\nThe difference between the plan's assets at the end of the year and the start of the year shows the decrease in the plan's assets. So, decrease in plan's assets = Plan's assets at the start of the year - Plan's assets at the end of the year = 40,800 - 39,650 = 1,150.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the gain or loss on plan assets\nGain or loss on plan assets is the difference between the service cost and the interest cost, adjusted for the decrease in the plan's assets. So, gain or loss on plan assets = 1"

In the \"market continues to rise\" scenario, the stock's value can be $45 after a 45% probability of the market continuing to rise (65%) and a 60% probability of the stock price reaching $45 (30%). So, the combined probability for this scenario is 0.65 * 0.60 = 0.39.\n2. In the \"market unchanges\" scenario, the stock's value can be $45 only with a 55% probability of the market unchanging and a 45% probability of the stock price reaching $45 (55%). So, the combined probability for this scenario is 0.55 * 0.45 = 0.2475.\n3.

We need to find the projected price value of a basis point (i.e., 0.01%) for this bond.\n\nStep 2: Define the variables\nLet's denote P as the current price of the bond (85.784357), YTM as the yield-to-maturity (5% or 0.05), and N as the number of years until maturity (9).\n\nStep 3: Use the formula for the price of a bond\nThe price of a bond is given by the formula:\n\nP = C * (1 - (1 + r)^(-N)) / r\n\nwhere C is the coupon payment, r is the yield-to-maturity, and N is the number of years until maturity.\n\nStep 4: Plug in the given values\nWe have P = 85.784357, C = 3% or 0.03, YTM = 5% or 0.05, and N = 9. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n85.784357 = 0.03 * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-9)) / 0.05\n\nStep 5: Solve for the rate r\nNow, we need to solve for the rate r. First, simplify the equation:\n\n1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-9) = (0.79062) / r\n\nNow, multiply both sides by r:\n\nr * (1 - (1 + 0.05)^(-9)) = 0.79062\n\nSince we have the price P and the coupon rate C, we can isolate r:\n\nr = (0.79062) / (P * C) = (0.79062) / (85.784357 *"

Since the growth rate is constant, we can use the formula:\n\nDividend in 4 years = Dividend ($0.22) * (1 + Growth rate)^4\nDividend in 4 years = $0.22 * (1 + 0.12)^4\nDividend in 4 years = $0.31\n\nStep 2: Calculate the discount factor for the terminal value:\nWe need to find the present value of the dividend in 2021, which is 4 years from now (2017 + 4 = 2021).

Since the growth rate is constant at 12% for the first stage, the discount factor can be calculated as:\n\nDiscount factor = (1 + Required Return)^Number of periods\nDiscount factor = (1 + 0.09)^4\nDiscount factor = 1.3464\n\nStep 3: Calculate the present value of the dividend in 2021:\nNow, we can find the present value of the dividend in 2021 by multiplying the discount factor by the future dividend:\n\nPV of dividend in 2021 = Discount factor * Dividend in 2021\nPV of dividend in 2021 = 1.3464 * $0.31\nPV of dividend in 2021 = $0.41\n\nStep 4: Calculate the terminal value (the stock price in 4 years):\nAs the first stage lasts for 4 years, we don't need to subtract the present value of the dividends in those years from the terminal value to find the stock price.

In this case, we have:\n\nCurrent share price = $56\nNet sales per share = $35\n\nP/S ratio = Current share price / Net sales per share\nP/S ratio = $56 / $35\n\nStep 4: Simplify the P/S ratio\nNow, we need to simplify the fraction to get the P/S ratio:\n\nP/S ratio = $56 / $35\n\nTo divide 56 by 35, we can use long division or division with remainders. In this case, the quotient is 1 with a remainder of 21.

However, these figures cannot be used directly to calculate EPS, as they do not represent the company's earnings.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nWithout the earnings or income figure, we cannot calculate the company's normalized EPS. Therefore, we need the earnings data to provide a meaningful answer to the question.\n\nThe answer is: Therefore, to calculate the company's normalized EPS, we need the corresponding earnings or income data.\n\n"

We are also given that the yield is 5%. Let's calculate the change in bond prices for each bond.\n\nFor the first bond, the modified duration is 1 year, so the percentage change in price for a 1% change in yield would be (1 * 0.01) * -1 = -0.01 or -1%.\nFor the second bond, the modified duration is 9 years, so the percentage change in price for a 1% change in yield would be (9 * 0.01) * -1 = -0.09 or -9%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the potential loss for the portfolio\nNow, let's consider the portfolio as a whole. The total investment is $20 ($10 for each bond). If the yield increases by 1%, the first bond will lose 1% of its value, and the second bond will lose 9% of its value.

So, $1,110,000 / 0.45 (desired equity allocation) = $2,466,667.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the equity allocation of James' financial capital.\nWe need to find out how much of James' financial capital should be allocated to equity. This can be done by dividing the desired equity allocation by the total value of his financial capital and then subtracting the equity value of his human capital. So, ($2,466,667 - $360,000) / $750,000 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nStep 6: Provide the final answer.\nTherefore, the financial capital equity allocation for James should be 60%.\n\nThe answer is: the financial capital equity allocation for James should be 60%."

It can be used to find the intrinsic value of a stock.\n\nStep 3: Modify the DDM for the given problem\nIn this problem, we have no dividends for the first four years and a constant dividend growth rate after the fifth year. So, we can modify the DDM formula as follows:\n\nIntrinsic Value (V) = (D5) / (r - g)\n\nwhere V = intrinsic value\nD5 = dividend in the fifth year\nr = required rate of return (12% or 0.12)\ng = dividend growth rate (5% or 0.05)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the intrinsic value\nNow, let's plug in the values we have:\n\nV = (D5) / (r - g)\nV = ($2.5) / (0.12 - 0.05)\nV = ($2.5) / 0.07\n\nStep 5: Find the final answer\nNow, we just need to calculate the value:\n\nV = $2.5 / 0.07\nV ≈ $35.71\n\nSo, the intrinsic value of Firm B's stock is approximately $35.71.\n\nThe answer is: the intrinsic value of Firm B's stock is approximately $35.71.\n\n"

We need to find the value of the bonds when they are issued.\n\nStep 2: Identify the method\nWe will use the discount method to calculate the value of the bonds when they are issued. The discount method is a method of valuing bonds where the present value of the bond is determined by discounting the future cash flows at the appropriate discount rate.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the discount rate\nWe need to find the discount rate, which is the difference between the market interest rate and the yield of the bonds.

The share price is $26.00, and the daily volatility is 1.5%. We are given a 1-day holding period and a 95% confidence level.\n\nStep 2: Apply the delta-normal approach\nThe delta-normal approach is used to calculate the VaR. In this approach, we assume that the asset price follows a normal distribution. The standard normal distribution is also known as the Z-distribution.\n\nStep 3: Find the Z-score for the 95% confidence level\nFor a 95% confidence level, we need to find the Z-score that corresponds to the 2.5% in the left tail of the distribution. Using a Z-table or calculator, we find that the Z-score is approximately -1.96.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the expected change in the asset price\nThe expected change in the asset price is the product of the asset price, the delta, and the volatility. In this case, the expected change is:\n\n$26.00 * (-0.5) * 1.5% = -1.95\n\nStep 5: Calculate the VaR\nNow, we can calculate the VaR by multiplying the expected change by the Z-score:\n\nVaR = -1.95 * -1.96 = 3.85\n\nSo, the VaR for the given scenario is $3.85. This means that there is a 95% chance that the loss on this position will not exceed $3.85 over a 1-day holding period.\n\nThe answer is: This means that there is a 95% chance that the loss on this position will not exceed $3.85 over a 1-day holding period.\n\n"

We need to compute the VaR (Value at Risk) for this stance using the delta-gamma approach, assuming a maximum crude oil price shift of $2.00 per barrel.\n\nStep 2: Identify the formula\nThe delta-gamma approach involves two formulas:\n\n1. For the expected profit or loss, we use the formula:\n   Expected P/L = Delta * Price Shift\n\n2. For the VaR, we use the formula:\n   VaR = (Expected P/L) * Factor\n\nThe factor is a value that depends on the desired level of confidence for the VaR calculation.

            "\n\n1. Firstly, we need to calculate the number of shares that can be purchased with the initial investment of $20,000. Since each share costs $25, we can divide the total investment by the cost of each share to find out how many shares can be bought. Therefore, we have:\n\nNumber of shares = Total investment / Cost per share\nNumber of shares = $20,000 / $25\nNumber of shares = 800\n\nSo, the investor can buy 800 shares with the initial investment.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the value of the account after the shares have been purchased. To do this, we can multiply the number of shares by the cost per share. Therefore, we have:\n\nValue of account = Number of shares * Cost per share\nValue of account = 800 * $25\nValue of account = $20,000\n\nSo, the value of the account after the shares have been purchased is $20,000.\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the minimum value that the account must maintain to avoid a margin call. This is done by multiplying the value of the account by the maintenance margin, which is 70% in this case. Therefore, we have:\n\nMinimum value = Value of account * Maintenance margin\nMinimum value = $20,000 * 70%\n\nMinimum value = $14,000\n\nSo, the minimum value that the account must maintain to avoid a margin call is $14,000.\n\n4. Finally, we need to calculate the initial price that will trigger a margin call. This is done by dividing the minimum value of the account by the number of shares. Therefore, we have:\n\nInitial price = Minimum value / Number of shares\nInitial price = $14,000 / 800\n\nInitial price = $17.50\n\nSo, the initial price that will trigger a margin call is $17.50.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $17.50.\n\nThe answer is: 50.\n\n"
