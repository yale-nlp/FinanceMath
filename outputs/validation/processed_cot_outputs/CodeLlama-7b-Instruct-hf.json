            " So, the first problem we need to think about is how to calculate the 180-day forward points. To calculate the 180-day forward points, we can use the spot exchange rate, Libor interest rate, the tenor of the financing, and the \"compounding basis\".\n\nA 180-day tenor means that the forecasted exchange rate will be applied to the spot exchange rate 3 times, so I need to calculate the forward exchange rate at 3 points in time. The first point will be ten days later, second will be 180 days later, third will be three times in the third 180 days later, which is equal to 480 days back from the current date. Based on that, we can use the spot exchange or rate then plus/minus 0.375 times the coupon rate combined with the Libor interest rate at each of those three point dates.\n\nOnce we have the three points in time, we get the three forward exchange rates. Now we would like to take the three points and do \"compounding-proportion to compounding\" to the \"nominal annual interest rate\" and apply to all three points in time. This will give the corresponding 180 points forward exchange rate rates.\n\nNow, let's go ahead and compute the three points in time:\n\n- (spontex rate * $$hat)+libor180p{(spontex rate * $$hat)+compoundedln180p(libor)}\n- (spontex rate * $$hat)+libor60p{(spontex rate * $$hat)+compoundedln60(libor)}\n- (spontex rate * $$hat)+libor36q{(spontex rate * $$hat)+compoundedln36(libor)}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $$\\Bigl(2.0979\\times 1.9875+0.01\\times (1.6025+1.1487))\\Bigr)+\\Bigl(2.0979\\times 1.9482+0.01\\times (1.6025+1.1487))\\Bigr)+\\Bigl(2.0979\\times 1.9361+"

            "\n\nThe annual risky returns of securities are assumed to be autonmous because the means is zero and the basic distribution is same for daily and the annual returns. Therefore, we can use the formula for cumulative normal increse, CDF(Z) = P(Z  <= z) where Z is normally distributed with zero mean and standard devitaion 1. However, this is just for normal distribution and we need to specify the distribution parameter for this particular distribution. usually, derivation of distribution parameter is a Macular calculation. let's research a bit further how to calculate the distribution parameter for the given data; apparently, this is called Parametric VaR. To calculate annualized VaR of daily log returns of securities, the annualized daily volatility needs to be estimated using EWMA (Exponential Weighted Mean Absolute Deviation. Formula is : AV(X, t) = EWMA(D, 1/t, t *days). Moreover, daily returns are absolute, they do not change its sign during the day irrespective of the direction of the market. The EWMA uses exponetial weightage towards more recent data. the weightage of daily data falls off exponentially over time. Consequently, we can write the EWMA for the given formula; EWMA(returns, t, delta *days) = alpha \\* returns +(1-\\alpha) \\* EWMA(returns, t, delta *days) if the return is positive else EWMA(returns, t, delta *days) = alpha \\* -returns +(1-\\alpha) \\* EWMA(returns, t, delta *days) if the return is negative. This means the daily return is accumulated exponentially on the amount of weightage allocated to the return. Let's set the exponentiall weighting parameter; defn of alpha = exp( -log(1/250) * (t \\* (250 readily))\"); // calculate the variance for the daily returns (defn returns = D.log(D.pmin(returns, (returns *10)))); // deviaotion.r.variance := self.return. *map(^).unary.argmax(_2 + 1); varnce variance := (sum) returns ^ 2); varg. := devia.^2"

            "\n\nFirst thing first, we need to find the first years total dividends. This comes out to be $1 + ($0.5 * 2) = $3. Therefore, the variable first_year_dividend equals $3.\n\nThe next year's total dividends in year 2 is 6% higher than year 1, so the next year's total dividends is $1 + ($0.5 * 2) * 1.06 = $3.24. Therefore, the variable next_year_dividend equals $3.24.\n\nThe worth of the common equity can be calculated by: Preferred equity + Common equity. We may assume that the preferred equity worths nothing at present since it does not generate dividends.\n\nIn year 1, the common equity represents $5 - $3 = $2 in our study period. In year 2, common equity decreases as half of the dividends ($3.24) increases, represents  $2 / 1.06 = $1.84 in our study period.\n\nTherefore, the first years' worth of the common equity equals $2.\n\nThe second years' worth of the common equity represents 50% of the first year's worth, $1.84 / 2 = $0.92 in our study period because both years apply a 6% after-tax growth rate.\n\nWhat will be the total worth of the common equity in 2 years? By compounding, we would forecast that occurs in both years, so the total worth is $2 + $0.92 = $2.92 by the end of year 2.\n\nWhat was the total worth of the common equity if it were held back for a 10% rate of return? Investing for 0.10 times the worth would result in a 10% return of the total worth from year 2. Since the total worth of common equity doubles in the two years' time, the present value of the common equity's worth at the end of years 2 would be the present value of $2 + $0.92 = $2.92.

So, given that Yahoo Corp.is a dominant player and the price elasticity of demand is 1.8, we stand to find the pattern of change in price and cost with the change in price.  Suppose at price p, average cost of Yahoo Corp. will be C + M$.\n\nIf the demand changes by 1 unit at a price p, the cost will be $C + M$.\n\nTherefore, the marginal cost of change is $M.\n\nFrom the market analysis, we learn the $average cost=$ 50 and $Marginal$ cost=$ 30.\n\nNow with the information given, we can answer the question.\n\nAs the price elasticity of demand (1.8), at half change in price, amount by which average cost will change is $M$.\n\nTherefore, 1_ ___  0=30 + M ____\n\n0.8 = 30 + M\n\nNow, solving the equation,\n\nM = 30 + 0.8 - 30 = 0.8 - 0.8 = 0.\n\n$ Hence, M= 0.\n\n$ For any change (h), you should be able to find out $m for it by using the equation $ m=M*h/\\left(1-h\\right)$ , where m is the profit percentage at a $ h$ % unit sell-off.

            "\n\n### The First Step\n\nAs the question is asking for the cost per 100 of par value for 15 years with a given market discount rate of 4.5%:\nFirst, you need to settle what is the duration of the bond with maturity period of 15 years.\nTherefore, you need to calculate the duration of this bond. Call its value $D$\n\nSince the discount rate is neglecting the effects of coupon payments, the formula for the duration of a bond can be used.\nWith original maturity $M$, coupon per year $Q$ and others chosing nondiscounted yield $r$, the formula could be written as follows:\n$$ \\frac{M}{D} = \\frac{r+Q(1+r)^{-M}}{Q(1+r)^{-1}}.$$\nSo you can see in the formula above the right hand side, the RHS of it, should be specified. Now sift to specify it with the value you have been given. The RHS needs to calculate the duration of this bond, which leads to how many months the bond can last. Finally you can use a conversion from months to years to settle it on the actual years for the bond. Given the time boundaries of the bond are 15 years, this expressed in the conversion to years could be reduced to 15/12.\nHence, the mission. Instead of taking $D$ as the discounting duration, we can take it as $D'= M/12$ where $M$ is the maturity of the bond in years. This is by just converting the years to months by a conversion.\n\nThus we have that the bond can be current by duration months, and the actual time of its duration is its years. Up to here, what we have calculated is the price of the bond when the coupon is not present, in whihc case the present value wrongly neglects to include the present value of  the annual face value of the bond.\n\n### The Second Step\n\nBased on the field of only coupon bond that only has a face value of $100 with a yearly mass payment from the time the bond want to be repaid until its maturity, which we are all familiar with the interest rate is $Q$.\nWe called it in"

It is necessary to assign the sample size of the populations when we are calculating t-test statistic. We can get it through following the formula: side to be calculated is the one-sided probability plus half of the two-sided probability. Also, the sample size to be calculated is significant, which means that you do not care too much about the bias. That is to say, the sample size should be larger than or equal to the required sample size. For two-sided t-test of independent samples there are two associated probabilities to be calculated:\n\n$ af(\\alpha/2) = $ For two-sided: $(1 - \\alpha) / 2 = (0.025$ 0.05 Not too large and not too little)\n\nSo it looks like the p-value that we need to compare to is 0.05 $The margin of error is not decided by P-value, but by the z-value area (that is $ for the most). It is important to remember that when the sample size is shrinking, whatever Z corresponds to P, when test is expanded, there is nothing to say that the Z value would also increase when Z = x increases (but probability of P's higher). For example, if you sample size is the same, Z1 does not necessarily equal to Z2. We can suppose the relationship between two variables is a straight line, let's plot a line in the arithmetic plot of Z and the P, then there is a continuous relationship between Z and P.\n\nFor example (which is S' = 18), one should also remember that the smaller the sample size, the bigger the margin of error is. For example, a smaller average itself does not mean that it is possible to compute a smaller margin of error. It is the process principle that makes Z1 smaller than Z2 $\n\nGenerally, the p-value in the very early years to have a very large number, as the small sample size is 10-15.

            " It's important to think about both financial concepts and real-life scenarios when calculating returns. To address the questions, there are several things to consider, such as:\n\n1. Continuous Time Implementation\n In terms of financial theory, multiple returns must be considered when calculating the real world return of a security. However, these returns mostly occur within a few months, and due to its nature, are often ignored. We are therefore going to ignore them and treat it as a single year return.\n2. Time Perception\nLike we said in the theory section, the idea that yields cannot be changed when the chosen period of time is changed is not concrete as it was said. However, we are going to ignore this idea and it's corollary, the \"compounding, continuos-like growth, and a never increase savings accounts\" principle. Therefore, there is time perception. That means the financial instrument is not at the same rate as the chosen time period. Instead, they are at the same rate as the real life rate.\n3. Real-Life Scenario\nAnnual Convexity refers to the annual effective rate of the security if the security were left at the current yield until the end of the period. A higher yield can be expected, as it represents the rise of the stock price, otherwise the security would not be worth purchasing, to begin with. It has to be taken into account in the real-life scenario when deciding if it's worth purchasing that security. However, that is another argument. It is valid until further notice.\n\nIt requires that we calculate the discounted expected future cash flows of the lower interest rate period to what is considered as the future cash flow of the longer interest-rate period. Therefore, the return after falling by 25 basis points is calculated to a 7.02 BP long period discounted 10% to a 7BP long term period(Using dynamic formula).\n\nDynamic Formula - As a Mathematical Interest Continuously Compounded Discovery of Future Income/Capital\nWhen Expected Capital CDs Continuously Compounding (Risk-Free Rate ad 0% Per Annum and Is Periodic. When Interest Rate increases continuously year over year)\nAccumlulations Capital at the Future Capital Rate  and previously accumulated Capital, is, at Continuously Compounding Period, much easier and"

From the whole collection, what is the proportion of top quality loans?\n\nBased on the proposition, the proportion of top quality loans is $(940 + 48) / (1000 + 600) = 0.25$. Therefore, the proportion of secondary quality loans is $0.75$.\n\n2nd question. If the researcher happens to pick a loan that is presently delayed in its payments, what is the proportion of loans that have made payments lately?\n\nFrom the whole collection, 600 top quality loans are good quality and 200 are late, which means, they have made payments recently. Therefore, the proportion of late loans among loans that have made payments lately is $0.2$.\n\n3rd question. As the proportion of late loans among loans that have made payments lately is less than the proportion of loans from the whole collection that have made payments lately, we can safely conclude that the proportion of late loans among loans that have made payments lately is always less than the proportion of loans from the whole collection that have made payments lately.\n\n4th question. If the researcher arbitrarily pick a loan that is presently delayed in its payments, what proportion of the whole collection has made payments lately?\n\nThis is the crucial question struck me. If we want to answer this question, we need to know what proportion of through quality loans make payments lately. Knowing the proportion of late loans and the proportion of through quality loans make payments lately, we can calculate this proportion. Using the law of probability, we can say that the proportion of late loans in the collection will be the same as the proportion of late loans among late loans. Therefore, the proportion of through quality loans that have made the payments lately is $0.25$.\nAnd therefore, the proportion of late loans is $0.75$.\n\n5th question.

Variance is `\"a measure of the amount of dispersions in distribution of a single datapoints in a sample or a population.\"` from wikipedia.\n\nSo now we have two different types of data:\n      1. The daily volatility rate, which is the volatility rate of the underlying share.\n      2. The delta, which is the rate of change of the option price with respect to the underlying share price.\n\nWe are supposed to calculate the 1-day 95% VaR of the option position if calculated via the delta-normal method.\n\nNow let's first tell the method. The method we chose to use to calculate the 1-day 95% VaR of an option is the delta-normal method. In this delta-normal method, it pretty much explain itself. The VaR of the option is calculated by the threshold level of the standard deviation of the delta of the option.\n\nSo let's create the following diagram to help you visualize the matter more clearly.\n\nThe interval VaR values of the delta-normal method have been calculated by the following formula:\n(0.01-alpha) FM+ alpha TM,\nwhere\nalpha is the confidence level, FM is the strik price, and TM is the TM, or the number of standard deviation to move above the delta value of the option. \n\nSo to compute the 1-day 95% VaR of your option, you have to use the above formula. \nThe TM should be ??

Specifically speaking, we need to find out the number of price changes in the nine months, and then calculate the overall costs during nine months.\nWe analyze the given information and find that the bid-offer spread is 0.10%, which implies that for every price change, the implied expenses are 0.10%. But it is compounded 0.32% per year.\nTherefore, each price fluctuation would cause a fractional expense to the investor. Firstly, we try to estimate how many times would be the price confused per year. For example, if the price fluctuates every day, it would be 365 times per year. By doing that, we can get the estimated number of price changes in the nine months.\nWe assume that the price changes are randomly and independently distributed, and then use the geometric distribution formula to calculate the percentage of successful price changes. Specifically, we calculate the parameter p, where 0.5 (p) = number of successful price changes in the nine months under a convention of the independent and identically distributed trials. In this case, we set the price fluctuates from the minimum to the maximum every day, and the testing times are 365 times.\nWe estimate the price changes are very likely to happen everyday, and the probability of price changes is 0.5.\nWe establish the expression for the overall cost. We also need to consider two additional expenses, which are the trading costs and management charges. The first one is bid-offer spread, the second is round-trip trading fees. Needless to say, every price change would incur both of them. To find out the resulting total overall holding period cost of the ETF, we need to calculate the annual compounding of these costs for nine months.\nWe use the formula below:\n\nC = P \\* (Dc + B interactions T)\nWhere C is the annual compound interest, P is"

Calculate an appropriate asset carrying cost for the existing intangible assets, using the future growth rate\n3. Take a time value of money approach to calculate the present value of the expected future returns of deploying the intangibles to archive\n\nThe rate of return is easily calculated by using an end-of-day Sella parameter. Analyze the three information entries in the table at the left to find out \n\nthe end-of-day Sella parameter.\n\nLet's simplify and store the rate into an local variable\n```\nrate = 7%\n```\nWe know the half-life of TMT intangible assets is 10 years.

Since the researcher already knows the price, we only need to find out the number of shares traded in the market.\n\nOut of 10 million share outstanding, 1 million is the number of shares that was traded in the market.\n\n$20 divided by 1 million\n\nAnswer: So, the current market rate is 20.\n\nFinally, we can find out the subsequent book value per share. To be exact,\n\n($30 / 20 * 10) / 10 - ($30 / 20 * 1) = $15\n\nTherefore, the answer is $15\n\nIt's essential to note that, even though the calculations were completed step by step, we first had to fill in the blanks which involved a straight parallel linear algebra problem with the answer in the direction of each row after doing column addition. Then we multiply the number of shares bought by current market rate divided by that multiplication, in this case, divided by 1, and then adding the book value per share divided by one adding that multiplication, in this case, divided by 10."

It is about a tool called the 'Market Maker' - it takes over a stock to determine the price at which the transaction would occur. The Market Maker has to decide between two options. Each price needs to have a probability. The Market Maker makes accumulation and disbursement decisions.\n\n2. 'What happened to Novartis?' meaning 'What has changed for Novartis?' Oh yes, according to our analogy with the Market Maker - we gave the company 100 basis points points tighter. In other words, we gave the company an incentive to re-price its 8-year bond in order to increase its value.\n\n3. 'What in Gilts?' meaning 'What in Gilts bonds?'  What is Gilts? It is an alternative name on Gilts bonds. These bonds are mainly traded in foreign markets when gilts are not available. Hence Gilts are known as FTNS-gilts. There are two types of Gilts bonds. One is 8-year, and the other is 10-year.\n\n4. Now we know what Novartis and Gilts are. The question is on which the Market Maker positions its transaction.\n\n5. The -0- in the question -0- means that the yield is -0- basis points that is if Y is the conventional return.\n\n6. Now we know the Y -0- basis points can be represented at 0.0% to 0.10%.\n\n7. The grand motion of 100 basis points indicates a pricing of a bond by 1.0%. In the particular case of Gilts -0- bonds, the difference in yield is 100 basis positions. Intuitively, this level of interest in usury reveals the dropping application. In terms of the conventional bond payout F(Rate) increases and the return increases.

We need to calculate P(A | B).\n   P(B | A) = 0.5\n\nHere P(B | A) means the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy. 0.5 means that we can predict 50% that a \"good\"rated bond will go to bankruptcy.

We can also use Bayes' formula.\n\nP(A | B) / P(B | A) \n\nAs we mentioned in the beginning, P(B | A) is a probability of a \"good\" \nrated bond will go to bankruptcy.

I.e. the forward rate is, in other words, 88% of the current spot rate. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nTherefore, 88% of 1.02 percent is 0.902 or 9%\n\nHowever, in the special case where it is asking for 1 year spot forward rate two years in the future. We must use this formula:\n((1 + forward rate)^1 - present)/forward\n. -1 for minus 1 year in the future \n\nTherefore,\n((1 + 0.09)^-1 - 1.02)/0.09 = -2.42/-2.6 = -0.92 or -9.2%\n\nTherefore, the answer is -9.2%.\n\nHow would you encourage a beginner question bank candidate?

The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues.

            " To calculate the portfolio's revenue, we need to apply the formula \"Pre-tax profit x expected years of healthy operation\" according to the rule that \"An FX pre-tax profit is maintained for the life of the loan portfolio if the loan portfolio maintenance expense is less than or equal to the FX depreciation and amortization. \" We can get pre-tax profit using the rule as well as operation cost. Also, we need to aviod the unexpected loss. Therefore, we just calculate the revenue.\nTherefore, the ratio of revenue attributable to owners, RAROC = (1.07/1.03-1)x(6/1.03).\n\n\nAlpha Code:\nRAROC = (1.07/1.03-1)x(6/1.03)\nTherefore, the answer of the RAROC is 0.932058.\n\nbeta:\nThe definition is converted MRR/EBITDA, minimum rates required to recapitalise the portfolio. Following the market requirement the minimum quoted interest rates for LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) and PLN (Libor Principal and Closing Nationals) should be greater than or equal to LIBOR-3(MM) based on the London Bankers Society's December 2016 value of 2.36%. There are options to specify a higher set of rate constraints. To obtain the security requirement, we have to figure out the security ratio, required capital to cover the portfolio's present and past unexpected repayment costs and changes in levels to protect the financials. Now the definition of expectation is inversely related to expectation in EBIT and EBITDA. The ratio needs to follow the formula:\n                   RAROC = RAROC × ((1+yq/n–R)T+yqT)/(rT)\nWhere: r = risk-free rate and discounted cash flows increasing yr until the lives of the portfolio, n = n lives fixed yearly compound.\nThen we can calculate the RAROC as below:\n  ((1+ 0.01) / 1 - 0.003) x ((6 / 1) + (0."

            " \n\nCunningly, we can consider the share value at the beginning of each inter-quarter. However, there is a good chance we will have negative share value. It won't make sense to express a negative share value in dollars. Therefore, we consider each quarter, take out the cash payout, then put that cash into our investment to yield a dollar we get every quarter. Therefore, we can use a compound interest rate of 6% per quarter to see how the share price value changes. \n\nWe start at the first quarter to know the value of the share. \nThe share begins with a borrowed $2. \nAfter season 0, we have cashed out $4, and have to see if our borrowed $2 can become $4 in six months.\nWe distribute $4 among its 6 months. The cash flows are $0.67 in eight days, $0.67 in four, and a little sum of $0.05. Hence, we have to consider it as $2.56 on the \"(double curly brackets)\", because the real cash is always greater than $0.00. Then, we have to think on the next step. In terms of share price, the value actually comes from the return being we call r. The annual interest rate for each quarter is 6%. So the interest per quarter is \"r * quarterly_rate\". For an investment whose:\nFor the next thoyrd=\"d$\" we have \"R\".

Note that d is not the somehow we can get back to 1 for a quick compudanr interest rate calculation When d grows to 1, the equation fundmentally becomes 0 = 0+ 0* 0! R should be > d. \nHere, to start with, we put in a value of D=2.47(2.00+ 0.02) \nput in $2.47 because the cash we already got from one quarter. \nIt should actually be $6"

            "\n\nIn this problem, we would use the straight-line amortization method to calculate amortization. The formula for amortization is\n\nAccumulated Amortization = （Depreciable Amount / Life of the asset） × number of years still remaining for appraisal\n\nFirst, we need to know and figure out the three main components that are required for the formula above.\n\nFocus in on the first component which is Depreciable Amount. Special note that the corporation does not have to record depreciable asset, as stated in the problem. Instead, it may purchase a license (or right to use some technology or codebase), which is treated as an oth side asset. The value of this license cannot be depreciated. Therefore, we can optionally apply the 5% income tax rate when computing accordingly. It is probably safe that the annual amortization against the license will be in cash, unlike the amortization against the productive properties of a company. In our example, the annual amortization for the license should be fixed at $1,875 which is less than $6,500 that the corporation has charged for the license. The final monthly amortization amount against the license should be recomputed.\n\nThe second component is $6,500 which is the charge that the corporation has paid for the license.\n\nThe third component is 4, which is the remaining life of the asset. (Specifially in this case, 4-3 = 1 year). We can replace 4 with different numbers to calculate how much the corporation has to amortize against the license each year.\n\nIf we plug-in the formula into the workbook, we would get an answer like this:\n\nAccumulated Amortization = $6,500 / 1 = $6,500\n\nTherefore, the answer is $6,500, which represents the sum of amortization against the license.\n"

            "\n\nTo answer the question, you need to perform simple calculation. 1- The occurrence of the 'number of defective vehicles' ~ Poisson distribution. Derivation can be via Derivation 1. The derivation can be derived from the following equation x - Poisson distribution.\n2- The likelihood of the 'number of defective vehicles' being 'k' when the probability of drawing 'k' defective ones is given by;\n\nP(k). You can used argument that exactly 'k' horray cars will be drawn as you had stated = probability of exactly one success for k .There must be a success (defective vehicle) in the 5 random draws\n\nwhere = probability of exactly one success for k + probability of exactly two successes for k+1; etc. given by equation\n\n=(((7/20)^k)/k!)*((19!/3^19)) Note to break down probability of exactly one K is\nC(19,3)when it is independent because exact is =((7/20)^2 - (7/20)^(4) )\n\n= (131*130)\n131 and 130 (how many 2/1 success with exactly 2 success)\n\nP(r) = r.((p/(1-p)) )\nwhere P(11) is probability of exactly 3 success for 11.

These bonds added inflation protection by allowing you to incur curtailment of coupon payments, as you guessed, in the event that the inflation rate exceeded the coupon rate. The inflation protecting mechanism works as follows: Since the 1980s, the NYSE has enacted and enforced an inflation protection requirement with its bonds and corporate notes. A host of regulatory mechanisms with the NYSE accomplish this.\n\nNote:\nThe question is tricky, need to act fast.\n\nAnswer: It's straightforward, I write this in Excel and get the output:\n\ntherefore the answer is 3%\n\nComment: I can't figure out the rule of the question.

            "\n\nWe can calculate the standard deviation of portfolio, let's name it `sp`. The formula of standard deviation is:\n\n`sp = sqrt(B1^2 + B2^2 - 2 \\*\\* B1 \\*\\* B2 \\*\\* correlation)`\n\nwhere B1 and B2 are the prior variance of each component, correlation is the correlation between two components, in our case it is 0.5, the formula should be like below:\n\n`B1 = var(Component X)` & `B2 = var(Component Y)` & `var(Component Y) = 6.2^2` = 38.96\n\nNow we know the value of B1, B2, and correlation in values, all we need is the formula to calculate the standard deviation. If we write the formula as:\n\n`sp = sqrt(B1^2 + B2^2 - 2 \\*\\* B1 \\*\\* B2 \\*\\* 0.5)`\n\nwe can simplify the formula like:\n\n`sp = sqrt((0.75^2 \\*\\* var(Component X) + 0.25^2 \\*\\* 38.96) - 0.75^2 \\*\\* 0.25^2 \\*\\* 38.96 \\*\\* 0.5)`\n\nAfter calculation, we can see the result is 10.184, therefore, our answer is 10.184.\n\nI hope this helps, Goodluck!\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nComponentX = 25\nComponentY = 75\n\ns_x = ComponentX*(var_x)\ns_y = ComponentY*(var_y)\n\ncorr = 0.5\n\nsp_sq = math.sqrt(s_x**2+s_y**2 - (s_x*s_y*corr))\n\nsp = math.sqrt(sp_sq)\n\nprint(sp)\n```\n\n```python\n648.91\n```\n\nWhat a great answer, but I have one detail it's definitely not that **168.91**, the result is correct which defeated my expectations.\n\n```python\n"

Since we have no information about the 'terminal cash flow growth rate', we need to assume that the output of initial year is $2,775,840.

Since we have no information about the downstream, we need to assume only one, that is the output of terminal year. So we can calculate Year 5.\n\nNow, we know the output of terminal year, which is $2,613,767. Therefore, we can calculate the growth rate of this output from Year 5.\n\nFrom final output, this is the answer of ' Growth rate of Real Estate #1, according to Exhibit 2?'.
