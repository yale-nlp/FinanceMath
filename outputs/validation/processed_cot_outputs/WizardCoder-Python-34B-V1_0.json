            " \n\n1. First, think what a zero-coupon bond is. \n\nA zero-coupon bond is a bond that doesn't pay interest regularly throughout its lifetime (like a bond with a coupon), but only at the maturity date. The face value (or par value) is paid out at maturity.\n\n2. Based on the question, we are given the maturity of the bond, which is 15 years. That means the bond will mature in 15 years from today.\n\n3. The bond is issued today, the purchase price for a zero-coupon bond is par value (face value) and there are no interest payments made over the lifetime of the bond until maturity.\n\n4. The question also provides the market discount rate at 4.5% (annualized) for compound interest. This means that the bond is being sold at a discount to face value due to risk and uncertainty in the economy.\n\n5. We also need to consider the time value of money and the time it takes for an investor to receive the bond's face value in 15 years.\n\n6. Since the bond is sold at a discount, the bond is priced less than its face value. To calculate the price of the bond, we use the present value formula:\n\nP = FV/(1+r)^n, where P is the bond's price, FV is the face value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of years until maturity. In this case, the face value is equal to par value.\n\nP = par value / (1+r)^n\n\nNow, let's use the given information to substitute the variables:\n\nP = par value / (1+r)^15\n\nP = par value / (1+0.045)^15\n\n7. In order to calculate the cost per 100 of par value, we need to divide the bond's price by the par value, which is the total cost of the bond:\n\nCost per 100 = P/par value = par value / (1+r)^15 / par value\n\n8. Now, assume the par value is $1,000.\n\nCost per 100 = 1,"

Each 1% change in interest rate is associated with a 0.01-basis point change in the bond price, so the risk premium is equal to 0.004 (40 bps) times the square of the bond's duration. Since we are not given the duration of the bond, let's assume it is 2 years. Therefore, the bond price will increase (decrease) by 0.01 x 40 bps for each 1% increase (decrease) in the interest rate. Therefore, the new bond price after considering risk is:\n\n938.35 - (0.03 x 0.004 x 2) = 937.86 for 10% and 939.05 for 6%.\n\nFinally, we need to discount these values at a 2-year period given an initial 1-year interest rate of 8%. Therefore, the bond's current value will be:\n\n937.86 x (1/(1+0.08)^2) + 939.05 x (1/(1+0.08)^2) = 886.23.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the zero-coupon bond is EUR 886.2"

To evaluate the assertion that the investment strategy yields a standard deviation of monthly returns below 5.0%, we can use a z-test statistic computation in excel.\r\n3. z = (observed value - expected value) / (standard error)\r\n4. The z-test statistic will help to determine whether the observed value (i.e., 4.9%) is significantly different from the expected value, which is 5.0% in this case. \r\n\r\nWe have all the values except for the standard error. To calculate that, we need to use the formula:\r\n\r\nStandard error = standard deviation / square root of the sample size (in this case, we don't know the sample size, so we can assume it as 12 since monthly returns are given). \r\n\r\nTherefore, standard error = (4.9% / sqrt(12))\r\n5. So, standard error = 0.2191, using Excel's SQRT function.\r\n6. Now, we can compute the z-test statistic:\r\n\r\nz = (4.9% - 5.0%) / 0.2191, which equals -0.429\r\n7. This means, the observed value (4.9%) is 0.429 standard deviations below the expected value (5.0%).\r\n8. Finally, we can check in a z-table or a statistical software to determine whether this falls below the 5% level of significance (i.e., if the z-value lies within the range of -1.96 to 1.96).\r\n9. Since the z-value is less than -1.96, we reject the null hypothesis (i.e., the investment strategy does not yield a standard deviation of monthly returns below 5.0%) and conclude that the assertion is true, as the returns are higher than expected, with a significance level of 5%.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the test statistic's value is -0.429.

This means that the market returns can be modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of $160,000 and a standard deviation of $30,000. Therefore, we need to find the percentage of returns that are below $100,000 and normally distributed. \n\n1. Calculate the z-score for $100,000 using the formula $z = (x - \\mu) / \\sigma$ where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. We have $\\mu = 160,000$ and $\\sigma = 30,000$. So, $z = (100,000 - 160,000) / 30,000 = -0.5$.\r\n2. Now, we use a normal distribution table or a calculator to find the area to the left of the z-score of $-0.5$ in the standard normal distribution. We find that the area is $0.3413$. Therefore, the probability of the fund's returns being below $100,000$ is $0.3413$ or $34.13\\%$. \n3.

Smith bought soybean futures at $865/bushel in a fully collateralized long position on the beginning of the transaction and held it for three months, and then rolled it three months later at $877/bushel and $883/bushel for the long and short contracts, respectively, respectively.\r\n2. To calculate the total return, we need to calculate the profit/loss (PL) on the long and short positions. The PL on the long position is calculated as follows:\r\n$883 - 865 = 18$ per bushel\r\nThe amount of PL is multiplied by the number of bushels in the transaction, which is necessary to determine later.\r\n3. The collateral earned on the long position is 0.6% per annum, which is equivalent to 0.0060 in daily rate. \r\n4. The total return on this position is calculated by taking into account the PL on the long position and the interest earned on collateral.\r\n5. Therefore, the total return of the soybean futures transaction for Zenith Fund is:\r\n$(883 - 865) * long_bushels + (0.0060/365) * long_bushels = total_return$(approx.18471)$\r\n(Note: Assuming one year has 365 days)\r\n6. We need to know the size of the long position in bushels to calculate the total return. Otherwise, we cannot calculate the total return.\r\n7. When Smith says \"the Zenith Fund entered a fully collateralized long position,\" it means the size of the long position is equal to the number of short positions taken. "

            " The first thing we have to consider is what happens when a monopolist sets a price above the marginal cost and below the average cost. In a competitive market, this would result in a very small quantity being produced and sold, but in a monopoly, the producer can decide to maximize profits by producing and selling as much as it can at the price it sets, which is not affected by competing firms. In other words, the demand will increase as the price rises, so the profit will increase if the price is above the marginal cost. The demand will fall if the price is below the marginal cost.\r\n\r\nBased on this, we can use the basic assumption that in a monopoly, profit is maximized at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This occurs when the quantity produced and sold is equal to the quantity demanded at the price that the monopolist sets. \r\n\r\nIf P > MC, the marginal revenue (MR) will be P x demand, and the marginal cost (MC) will be equal to the fixed cost of production plus the variable cost, which is assumed to be $30 in this case, since average cost = MC + VC. We can write the equation:\r\n\r\nP x demand = 30 + (P – MC)\r\n\r\nTo find the quantity demanded, we can substitute MR with the equation: \r\n\r\nP x demand = 30 + (P – P)\r\n\r\nWe can simplify this equation to: \r\n\r\nP = 30 + 30\r\n\r\nSo the monopolist will set the price equal to $60 to maximize profits. At this price, the marginal revenue is $60 x demand. The demand will be higher at a lower price, so we need to find the range of price where profit will be maximized:\r\n\r\n60 x demand = 30 + (P – MC)\r\n\r\nDemand = (30 + (P – MC)) / 60 -> this is the demand function.\r\n\r\nSince we know that the price elasticity of demand is 1.5, we can find the quantity demanded using the formula:\r\n\r\nDemand = (30 + (P – 70)) / 60\r\n\r\nNow we need"

This implies that the bond has a value of 97 at the present time. The present value is the amount that you would need to pay today to purchase the bond and receive the same cash flows as if you held it to maturity.

(unknown)\n\nTherefore, there is not enough information provided in the table to calculate the final value (i). We need to know the initial investment amount to solve for i. With this information, we can calculate the total return over the three-year period. However, as mentioned earlier, we cannot determine the total return without knowing the beginning and ending values of the investment. Therefore, we cannot calculate the holding period return for a specific number of years. "

Also, we are given the amount of collateral required to hedge a short position and the longer term investment for the securities portfolio, which is $750 and $500 respectively. \n\nAs we know, the overall return of a hedge position is the excess return above the risk-free rate, which is the return on the hedged instruments minus the cost of the hedge.

Calculate the return on the hedged instruments (securities portfolio): \n- The securities portfolio returns 1% (free rate) on a $750 investment for a period of 1 year.

            " The credit score is not relevant to the economic concept of duration and convexity, so we can ignore it. We are only interested in the change in spread. Is the question asking about the impact of a change in spread on the yield of the bond or the expected return of the bond investor? Only the latter makes sense since the former is determined by market conditions. So, let's assume the change refers to expected return.\n\n1. What is the expected return formula for a bond? It is given by the present value of the cash flows divided by the bond's price. The cash flows are the periodic payments and the final payment at maturity, which is 100 in this case, assuming a 100% probability of recovery. \n2. What is the effect of a change in spread on the bond's price? The spread is the difference between the bond's yield and the risk-free rate. If the spread tightens by 100 basis points, it means the bond's yield has decreased by 0.1 percentage point. \n3. What is the effect of a change in yield on the bond's duration and convexity? The duration is the time it takes for the bond to mature, which is proportional to the present value of the cash flows. A change in yield will affect the price and therefore the cash flows. The convexity is the second derivative of the price with respect to the yield, so it will change as well. We don't know the bond's previous yield or the new yield, so we can't calculate the exact effect on it. We can assume a proportional change in duration and convexity, i.e., a 100 basis point change in yield corresponds to a 100 basis point change in duration and convexity. \n4. What is the effect of a change in duration or convexity on the expected return? A change in duration will reduce the present value of the bond's cash flows, which will reduce the bond's price, which will in turn reduce the expected return. A change in convexity will have an opposite effect, increasing the expected return. \n5. Is the question asking about a proportional or absolute change? It's not clear, so let's assume an absolute change of 100 basis points. \n6. We need to calculate the expected return before and after the"

The modified duration and the modified convexity are technical terms used in finance that relate to the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates. The modified duration tells us how quickly the bond’s value changes in response to a change in interest rates, and the modified convexity measures the sensitivity of the bond's price to changes in yields.\n\nTo calculate the projected percentage price alteration, we need to know the current yield of the bond and the impact of a 50 bps drop in yield on its price.\n\nLet's assume that the current yield of the bond is y.

The coupon payment for Bond D is given by (1) 8% of the principal amount at the beginning of each year for 3 years and (2) the final payment at maturity, which is also equal to the principal amount because the bond is redeemed at maturity.\n\nTo find the present value, we can use the formula PV = c1/(1+r)^1 + c2/(1+r)^2 + ... + c3/(1+r)^3 + (100 + c3)/(1+r)^3, where 100 is the face value of the bond and c1 to c3 are the coupon payments.\n\nThe first coupon payment is made at the end of the first year, so it's 1/(1+r)^1, the second coupon payment is made at the end of the second year, so it's 1/(1+r)^2, and the last coupon payment, which is also the face value of the bond, is made at the end of the third year.\n\nSubstituting the values from the table, we have:\n\nPV = 8%/(1+7%)^1 + 8%/(1+7%)^2 + 8%/(1+7%)^3 + (100 + 8%)/(1+7%)^3\n\nPV = 0.08/1.07 + 0.08/1.14 + 0.08/1.21 + 10"

Since Clearwater has a 50% stake, it should pay half of the ¥360 million, which is ¥180 million. Therefore, the value of the license for Clearwater's balance sheet is ¥80 million.\n2.Clearwater assumes the responsibility for the share of Snowflake's debt and assumes the value of the licenses as an asset on its balance sheet. It can be deducted from the net assets' fair value of Snowflake to estimate the value of the licenses.\n3.To calculate the depreciation expense of the licenses, we need to use the straight-line method, which assigns a specific expense to each period of the economic expense. According to the given lifespan, which is 5 years, the depreciation expense is equivalent to the value of the licenses divided by 5 years. \nThe depreciation expense for the first year is therefore ¥80 million / 5 = ¥16 million or ¥16,000,000 per year.\n4.However, Snowflake is a separate company, and Clearwater does not have command over it. Therefore, we need to calculate the depreciation expense of Clearwater's licenses separately from that of Snowflake's assets.\n5.The depreciation expense for Clearwater's licenses is ¥16 million, as calculated in step 3.\n6.The independent depreciation expense of Snowflake's assets would be calculated using the straight-line method as well. The depreciation rate for each asset is determined by its useful life and the value of the asset divided by the lifespan.\n7.The total depreciation expense for 2019 would be the sum of Clearwater's depreciation expense and Snowflake's depreciation expense, which was ¥106 million in the 2018 financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ¥16 million + ¥106 million = ¥122 million, or ¥122,000,"

            " Firstly, we need to calculate the total nominal return of the mutual fund for the three-year period since its inception. \n\nTotal return = [(1 + 0.09)x(1 + 0.05)x(1 + 0.08) - 1] = 0.2489 \n\nNow, let's calculate the total tax accounted for the three-year period. The after-tax return for each year can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. After-tax return in year 1 = (1 + 0.09) - 0.25 x 0.1 = 0.0925 (since there is a 25% tax on capital gains)\n2. After-tax return in year 2 = (1 + 0.05) - 0.25 x 0.1 = 0.0475 \n3. After-tax return in year 3 = (1 + 0.08) - 0.25 x 0.1 = 0.0775 \n\nNow, we need to calculate the average after-tax return for the three-year period. This is done by taking the geometric mean of the after-tax returns:\n\nAnnualized after-tax return = (((1 + 0.0925)^(1/3) x (1 + 0.0475)^(1/3) x (1 + 0.0775)^(1/3) - 1) x 3 = 0.0738 \n\nNote that we raised each after-tax return to the power of 1/3 because the time period for each return is one year, and we want an annualized return. \n\nTherefore, the annualized after-tax return is 7.38%, or 7.38%.

In this case, the question mentions the \"advantages\" and \"disadvantages\", which can be related to a binary option. Let's assume that the option is a call option, where the payoff is $1 if the price of the base asset is above a certain strike price, and $0 otherwise. \n\nNow, we can calculate the discount factor for three months from today using the going rate of 4%.  The discount factor can be calculated as $e^{-rT} = e^{-0.04\\times 3/12} = 0.9788$.\n\nNext, we need to find the forward price of the option. The forward price can be calculated using the relationship:\n\n$$F = \\frac{P(s) - K}{S_0}\\times e^{-rT}$$\n\nwhere $F$ is the forward price of the option, $P(s)$ is the current value of the option, $K$ is the strike price, $S_0$ is the current price of the asset, and $T$ is the time to maturity in years. \n\nIn this case, we are given that $P(s) = 5$ and $S_0 = 50$. We also know that $T=0.25$ years (since three months = 3 months = 3/12 years). \n\nFrom here, we just need to find $K$. To do this, we can use the fact that $P(s)=C(s,K)$, where $C(s,K)$ is the cash-or-nothing call option payoff at present value. If we assume that $K$ is such that $P(s)=5$, then $C(s,K) = \\max(s-K,0)$, so we can solve for $K$:\n\n$$5 = \\max(S_0-K,0)$$\n\nIf $S_0 > K$, then $C(s,K) = S_0-K$. Therefore, $K$ must be chosen so that $S_0-K$ is as close to 5 as possible without being negative. In other words, $K$ must be as small as possible while still being greater than $S_0-5$."

Let's say the time horizon is 1 year.\r\n\r\nSince the bond-equivalent return should be the same as the effective annual return, we need to find the YTM of a bond that provides a 9% return after 1 year. To do this, we can use the present value (PV) and future value (FV) formulas. \r\n\r\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^t, where t is the time horizon in years. \r\n\r\nFV = PV (1 + YTM)^t\r\n\r\nIf we assume a 1-year horizon, we can rearrange the equation to: \r\nFV = PV (1 + r)^1\r\n\r\nSolving for YTM: \r\nYTM = (FV/PV)^(1/t) - 1\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values, we get: \r\nYTM = (1.09/1)^(1/1) - 1 = 0.09 \r\n\r\nThus, the return on a bond-equivalent basis is 9%.

We don't have any indication of the net income or other income/expense but we can use the increased retained earnings to estimate the operating cash flow.\n- Let's assume the net income from operations (operating income + other income/expense) for 2017 was $10 million. Given the increase in retained earnings, we can assume that the decrease in retained earnings of $15 (125 - 110) is equal to net income from operations + other income/expense. We'll assume $5 million for net income from operations and $10 million for other income/expense for 2017.\n- Now, net cash from operating activities = adjustments to net income (operating income + other income/expense) + depreciation - depreciation + gain/loss on sale of assets - loss on sale of assets + changes in operating assets and liabilities\n- We don't have the depreciation or changes in operating assets and liabilities but we know that the impairment loss (loss on sale of assets) was $12 million in 2017. The total operating activities cash flow for 2017 would be $5 million (net income from operations) - $12 million (impairment loss) = $-7 million.\n\n2.

The Yield-to-Maturity is the return investors receive if they buy and hold the bond till the maturity and hence, it is a risk-free return.

This means that the P/S ratio will also decrease.\r\n\r\nThe new P/S ratio will be: P/S ratio = Share price / New Net sales per share\r\n\r\nTo get the new net sales per share, we can use the formula: \r\n\r\nNew Net sales per share = Net sales in slump / Number of shares outstanding.\r\n\r\nSince we are in a slump and the sales have decreased, we assume that the number of shares outstanding remains the same, as the company has not issued new shares during the financial year. \r\n\r\nNew Net sales per share = Net sales in slump / Number of shares outstanding = ($35 * market price of share) / Number of shares outstanding\r\n\r\nWe don't have the net sales in slump or the number of shares outstanding.

For each trade, we can calculate the effective spread by subtracting the ask price from the bid price (which is the highest price someone is willing to buy at) and divide it by 2. \r\n\r\n1. Trade #1: The ask price is $25.20, and the bid price is $25.17, so the effective spread is ($25.20 - $25.17)/2 = 0.03, or 3 cents. Thus, the total effective spread for this trade is 0.03 x 1,200 shares = 0.36. Since 5,000 shares are not available at this price, we assume that Smith buys all 1,200 shares at this price, and the remaining 3,800 shares must be filled at a higher price. \r\n\r\n2. Trade #2: The ask price is $25.22, and the bid price is $25.19, so the effective spread is ($25.22 - $25.19)/2 = 0.03, or 3 cents. For 1,300 shares, the effective spread is 0.39.

We already have Rf and Rm. The beta value is 0.6, and we don't know σp or μ yet. However, we can use a market index such as S&P500 to estimate μ and σp in practice. The S&P500 has a historical return of 15%, so let's assume that μ = 15%. \n\nStep 3. According to historical data, the S&P500 volatility is approximately 21%. We can use the volatility of the stock to estimate σp. The volatility of a stock can be calculated based on its historical returns using the standard deviation of the percentage changes of the stock price. Let's assume that the volatility of the stock is 24%.\n\nStep 4. Now, we have all the values in the CAPM formula.

            "\n\n1. What is the delta-gamma approach? \r\nDelta-gamma approach in option pricing refers to a method to estimate the value at risk (VaR) using the underlying stock price and its respective sensitivities to price moves, which are represented by delta and gamma. \n\n2. Given the sensitivities and maximum price shift, can we determine the maximum loss that the option stance can experience?\nYes, we can use the following formula to determine the maximum loss: \n\nMaximum Loss = Delta x Maximum Price Shift x (-1) + (1/2) x Gamma x Maximum Price Shift^2\n\nMaximum Loss = 10,0000 (-1) + (1/2)(-5,0000)(2)^2\nMaximum Loss = -10,0000 + 50,000\nMaximum Loss = -5,0000\n\nSo, the maximum loss is -5,0000 barrels.\n\n3. What is the probability of the maximum loss occurring?\nIf we are using normal distribution to model the crude oil price movements, the probability of the maximum loss happening is 0.05 or 5%. This probability can be derived from the standard normal distribution table where z-score = -1.645 and the continuity correction factor = 0.5. \n\n4. Multiply the maximum loss by the probability to get the VaR:\nVaR = -5,0000 x 0.05 = -2,500\n\nTherefore, the VaR for this option stance using delta-gamma approach is -2,500 barrels. "
