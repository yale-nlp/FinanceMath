For example:\n...Expactation...\nE(y_t)=E(y_{t-1})+α[μ-E(y_{t-1})]=α[P(t)-P(t-1)]≈α[0.07-0.03]=0.14.\n\n Using the data above, the moving average factor y_t would be approximately equal to 0.03 + 0.14 = 0.17. Therefore, the correlated expectation for February 2014 is approximately 0.17.\n\nIn addition, you have to set up your response with variables and variables that you know are common in finance. There are other variables you could use, but these are the most common.\n\nAnswer: The expectation for February 2014 would be about 0.27 or 27%."

From that, we can safely convert both EUR and GBP to USD using the inverse of the spot EUR/USD rate as calculated below:\n\n1/1.3860 = 0.7182\n\nNow we can convert GBP and calculate its equivalent to EUR and USD, which are:\n\n1/1.3860 * 0.6125 = 0.4465 as EUR\n(1/1.3860)^2 * 0.6125 * 0.4208 = 0.6819 as USD\n\nAnd corresponding GBP/EUR rate is :\n\n1/0.4465 = 2.2443\n\nTherefore, the best option is the golden cross-rate, or that in between two currencies with a smaller spot exchange rate. In this case, the EUR/GBP is the better conversion ratio than USD. Thus, the final answer is 2.2443.\n\nOutput date format\n```markdown\nTherefore the answer is 2.2443\n```"

The standard deviation is the measure of how the values are spread apart. The expected standard deviation is 4.9%. So, as long as the actual standard deviation is less than 5.0%, we can confirm the investment strategy yields a standard deviation of monthly returns below 5.0%.\n\nSecond, we can find the test statistic for evaluating the answer. For evaluating the traditional investment strategy, we use the z-score. To calculate the z-score, you need to use correct and conventional formulas. Now, I'm going to refer some classic formulas to solve your confusion. The z-score formula is: Z-score = (Observed value - Mean value) / Standard deviation. Once you have the observed value, the mean value, and the standard deviation, you can calculate the z-score for an investment strategy thing. Then you will know how many standard deviation the observed value deviates from the mean value. To illustrate this more clearly, assume the monthly return for the last four months has been 4%, 9%, 7%, and 6%. Here you will observe a mean return that is 10% (4+9+7+6/4), number of months has been 4, and z-score in this period has been Z-score = (10 - 4.9)/4.9 = 1.02152. This equation is saying that the investment results in the past 12 months are 1.02 standard deviations more above the mean investment portfolio return. If you apply this numeric analysis to other investment returns, you will understand the severity of each investment strategy.\n\nAs a result, the test statistic describing the investment strategy is 1.02152 in this case.

            "\n\nHence, the answer is 25% .\n\nAnswer Each Element\n\n1. What is a sustainable growth rate?\nSystemic growth should maintain at a Sustainable rate. A sustainable growth rate is a long-term growth rate at a linear relation, and the relation between the strength and speed of the sprint is stable. Intuitively, an economy grows in a sustainable rate when its production and income earned by individuals grow all at the same rate, not more, not less.\n\nCompared to the economic mixture formula, it actually means more trade, more foreign trade, and an increasing share of a country's GDP coming from foreign trade, and more financialization. In other words, if companies that rely heavily on debt trade are the best performing for an extended period, you have too much financialization and should not trust the growth signals.\n\nThis outcome is generated through an overly simplistic linear regression of GDP growth estimated from World Bank data where '2020' is the cutoff year between the slow growth era and the era of the outbreak.\n\n2. Given the variables:\n| security cost of equity(We) | tangible book value(tang) | market cap(Mc)  |\n| ------------------------     | ----- |\n|0.06 | 200,000  | 300000000|\n\nIf the tangible book value to market capitalization ratio (R=tang/MC) is less than 1, a stock is considered cheap and becomes more attractive.\nThen shareholders, traders, and investors will observe this stock and - when certain conditions are met - consider purchasing the stock or adding the stock to their portfolio. The purpose of the attractiveness of a stock is mainly to observe the stock, but in fact, the stock is finally not purchased.\n\n3. The given question is:\nWhat percentage increase in revenue for 2017 will make more attractiveListed in YangChunGuo. You need to find the range of R(tang/MC).\n\nFormula: R\nR = Knowing\nnumber of solutions = The interval\n\n4.  A security cost of equity of a stock is 0.06 if\nNone of the above, it is not sal"

How?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHowever, if we fail to get the original question, there isn't much wrong with the given answers.\n\nHey Aravind, the present value of the Chart A is:\n\n2 \\em{present value} \\strong{final payment}, pv = ( 2 + k ) / ( kk )\nwhere k is the growth rate per year.\n\nTo remove the 2 in equation from payment amount, we multiply the equation by 100 again:\n4580.995 = ( 2 + 0.08277 ) / ( 1.0827⁷ )\n\nThis will get 4581 which rounds up to change question to 2 years in the question.\nThe inherent value is the value of a stock that is not yet traded and includes growth rate. But since the company would have sold the stock, can we say that there is no inherent value?\n\nThe inherent value is the value of a stock value to each stockholder, which include all future preparable dividends starting with the next dividend. For example, if a dividend ?was paying out $1 for each share at the end of the first calendar year, the shareholder's inherent value would be $7.148 = 1/( 1 - growth rate ) + $1k.\n\nIf it is sold on the market, the settlements are the financial analyses of future dividend in the form of a present value. Shareholders should do their own financial analysis on the company and independently arrive at their own number.\nThe inherent value is merely a present value.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTherefore, the answer is $4581.\n\nAnswer:\nThe term \"The inherent value” does not seem to have much meaning in the question. Your data also don’t show the state of the dividend of the shares of the Smith company."

            " First, which type of bond is this? It is a bond that pays coupon at the end of its annual period. According to my understanding, this bond can be priced by swaps of cash flows of the bond.\n\nEach year, the bond owner can earn 3.7% of his investment, while spot rates are 3.7%. In the first period, the bond owner has to pay 5% of the bond vaule as the coupon rate. In the last two periods, the bond owner can earn 3.8% and 3.6% respectively. There is no performance gain during the first and last two periods. Therefore, first we take out the coupon rates to estimate the bond price. generically, the price of bond is determined by spot rates: K=P/C, where K is the price, P is the par value, and C is the coupon rate. \n\nI want the coupon rate to be 5% in this case due to the question. Therefore. I assume the par value is 2000000. Now the bond price is 2000000/5 = 400000. Since we have three periods, we have to multiply the bond price by 3 so that it returns the face value.

The future value of the discounted cash flows, accounting for the expected inflation rate of 3%, is calculated as follows:\n\nFV = PV*(1+p)^n // p is in encoded in 0.03\n\nSince there are 12 payments in 20 years, we can calculate the present price of the bond as:\nP = FV * (1 + p)^(-12) // 12 payments\nP = 100.00 * 1.03^(-12) // since the price at the beginning is 100.00\nP = 92.10\n\nNow that we have the bond price and the duration we can calculate the duration gap.

Title + Answer wordings are the same for each table (e.g., 'Hedge Currency Title' instead of 'Forward Currency Title').\n\nAnswer: The mark-to-market value at three months later is a result of two operations. Firstly, take the amount of forward sale and add USD\\EUR swap effect; value at initiate represents the forward price spread against the fair value swap. Secondly, multiplicate dollar amount by the discounted exchange rate to foreign currency. Second screencast later describes this in analytical detail.\n\nSince each share was purchased at EUR90, these represent 200,000 Euro shares. Remember that 1 Euro = $1.3935 at the beginning, and $1.4106 at three-months after import. To accurately convert from EUR to USD at any spot rate over a given time period, perform a geometric average.\n\nThe geometric average of $1.3935 and $1.4106 is $1.40205. Plug in 200,000 Euro shares into $1.40205, and you have the USD value at initiate of the Euro Shares at $280k. Add the component from the forward contract at initiate. Remember that forward sale acquired 200,000 Euro under EUR/USD forward contract at steady rate and convert it into EUR\\USD swap discount curve. Approximately 8.1 per hundred thousand Pierce Mayer at three-months, which is EUR/USD per thousand unit. Convert the share purchases into USD using the curve, -80.2k.

The formula is shown as followed:\nPv(T-3) = (1+i)^(3) \\* A\nWe know that A=1, i = 0.0833=8.33% and T=3\nSo, the present value (Pv or PV) at time 3 is:\nPV3 = 1.0833^3*1 = 1.275\nNow, we subtract all the partial payment to get the final amount (PV last year):\nPV Last year = PV3 - TP3 = 0.048\nFinally, let's pay attention to the last payment. The payment at time 3 is given as the 3-year bond that provides an annual interest payment at 10% coupon rate. To find the last payment, we need to discount all the present values at time 3; all payments after time 3 can be obtained that way.

However, we need to find out the Y number first. \n\n1. What's the formula of finding the y number? Y=Coupon Rate - Three-Month MPR\nWe already knew coupon rate and we also knew the three-month MPR for 31 March. Therefore, we may calcuate the Y number by the below formula:\nY=4.15%-1.55%=2.60%\n\n2. Now we got to know that Y number. Therefore, we could calculate the coupon rate which we want to know by the below formula:\n3-Month Floating Rate plus Y% = Coupon Rate\n1.35%+2.60%=4.95%\n\nAnswer: Therefore, the coupon rate for the interest remittance done on 30 June is 4.95%"

            "\n\nAnswer: Therefore, the answer is ... PASS\n\nLet's continue the conversation:\n100 basis point tighter spread to Gilts on Novartis's 8-year bond means 0.100/0.800 = 0.125point\n55.0 is the price sensitivity of a bond to a basis point change in yields. Thus, if a 100bp change in a 6.0 year bond's yield means a 6.0*0.100/0.055 point = $628.57 change in its price and a 0.100*0.055/(6.0*0.100) = 10.55 percent change in its yield. The new yield would be $2,470 totalpayment/146.89 period payment = 16.8 percent.\nTherefore, the return on the newly purchased 8-year bond is 16.8 percent.\n\nOr, if you are familiar with BGM model, you could also calculate YTM and YTM/100 as measures of overall performance as well.\nLet me know if any more questions.\n\nComment: @Ánh Khoa Nguyễn, why the return is 16.8%?\n\nComment: Can you please share the results to help you better?\n\nComment: Yes,the return is 16.8%, which means YTM/100 or the return/coupon is 16.8%.

Therefore, if we know what the beta of the stock is, and the expected market return, we can calculate the cost of capital with alpha being assumed to be zero for the purposes of this equation.\n\nThen, E(R) = r_c = r_f + β \\times E(m_t)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total expected return for the company by subtracting the cost of capital from the risk-free rate and adding the stock's actual return(E(R_x) - r_c + E_x/100)$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is E_x/100.\n\n```\n\n### Features\nYou already know what you should output and at the end, Just write the formulas based on your knowledge.

            " We have a number of uncertain events occuring in the connection. These are listed below:\n\nB  - \"good\" rating is given\nA  - jumps\nLet's consider the following elements:\n\nP(A)\nP(A|B)\nP(B)\nThese probability elements can be expressed mathematically as follows\n\nSample Solution:\nTo calculate probability of a company go ![bankruptcy][1]\n\nFirst, you need to calculate the likelihood of jumps. It makes up 20% of high-risk bonds.\n>Thus, probability of jumps(P(A)) is = ![Jumps][2]\n\nSecond, you need to calculate the likelihood of good rating resulting from jumps. It makes up 50% of bonds that went bankrupt.\n>Thus, likehood or probability of good rating resulting from jumps(p(B|A)) is = ![Denominator][3]\n\nThen we need to calculate the likelihood of a jump given the company has a good rating:\n>Thus, likelihood of jumps given good rating(p(A|B)) is = ![Numerator][4]\n\nNow we use Bayes' theorem: \n![Numerator][5]\n\nAnd divide the numerator by the denominator:\n![Deom][6]\n\nTherefore, the Bankruptcy with good rating = 0.23.\n```Therefore, the answer is 0.23.```\n\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9EdYd.png\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNLji.png\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/O2Le7.png\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLEXE.png\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDV5Y.png\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mkt6M.png\n"

The active return is the return of the fund vs. the benchmark (Stock1 + Stock2 + Stock3 + Stock4 + Stock5) - Benchmark. This gives you the added return of running a fund vs. a benchmark, or \"active return.\"\n\nIn this question, to find the Kurok Fund's reference return (or the benchmark return), we add the differentials of the five stocks, which is the total returns of the sample above. to find the Kurok Fund's returns, we need to multiply each stock's weight with its return and sum them up. Finally, we need to subtract the benchmark return to find the active return.\n\nBenchmark = + Stock1 * Benchmrk Weight1 + Stock2 * Benchmark Weight2...\n\nKurok portfolio returns:\n\nReturn at"

There's you'll have 12, which we understand is equivalent to one-twelfth of one, right?\n\nYou: Exactly, 1 for the year(365 days) and 12 for the month(30 days)\n\nExpert: Correct. and now, from there, we know the reciprocal of a year is 1/1, and then there is its quarterly quantifier which is 4 within a year.

Given that the overall allocation to bond and fixed income is $40,000,000, call that the combined bond allocation. And now we need to find out how many stock index futures to purchase so that only 40% of this total amount of bond has to be sold.\nFor this calculation, the bond futures will be issued at a value of $250. (Not to be confused with stock index futures.). A beta of 0.95 and buy one country bond index futures for every $250 on the stock index futures. Therefore, $250 divided by $1200 for the index = 0.2083. In order to replace 40% of the combined total bond assessment, 40% of $40M equals $16M in bond futures contracts. How many stock index futures will be required to purchase? $16M divided by (0.2083 x $1200) equals 6804.3 futures contracts. If we assume two-thirds of the stock index funding will alleviate the impact of the risk adjustment, 6804.3 divided by 0.67 or around 10,852.\nSince $6804.3 appears to be a fractional amount, we need to round it to the next whole number as there is no such thing as part of a bond futures contract, and add 1 to the whole number to reflect the risk marginal contribution of the appropriate number of stock index futures required to address this risk adjustment.\nThus, 28,492 fut"

There is an nice formula that expresses this,Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)+2Cov(X,Y)=17.9+6.2+2x0.5=21.6+10.9=32.532=? %.

The answer shoule be a numeric value.\n\nIf the odd and p value are 23.3 and 1.692e-05 respectively, what does this indicate? What does this table indicate? Only low p values reflect evidence against the null hypothesis\n\nComment: It seems like in this case, the table indicates what we want it to. Note the entry in the \"Area Under\" column which shows us that for this pvalue, the area under the chi-squared distribution is (very close to) 0.0466. This tells us that the p-value is less than .05 and thus, we do have"

            "\nThe management fee formula for a \"2 and 20\" fee scheme:\nannual management fee = 2/100 \\* asset value at the start of the year + 20/100 \\* asset value at end of the year\nIn this scenario, we should pay for the management fee in the start of the year, so the management fee would be:\nm = \\$2,400,000 = 2/100 \\* 160,000,000\nThe user has provided you the value of the investment assets for the beginning of the current year. Investopedia says a soft hurdle rate is the rate of return an investor must generate before he is incentivized to take on additional risk with a private placement investment. So we need to know how much the investments have increased or decreased so we can tell if an investment manager generated a return exceeding the soft hurdle rate to be paid an incentive fee. To calculate the incentive fee, we need to know the initial high-water mark that was set prior to taking the risk, which was $198,000,000 in this case. An incentive fee is simply the portion of the gain above the initial high-water mark if you break the soft hurdle rate. The incentive fee is calculated as follows:\nnet incentive fee = gain above the (initial high-water mark - annual management fee)\nIf the gain is less than the soft hurdle rate, then there is no incentive fee, which makes the net incentive fee 0.\nTo calculate the ife we need to get the gain of the portfolio so we can know the incentive fee.\nThe phrase \"asset increase by 25% in the coming year\" means all the current value of the portfolio multiplied by 1,25. The assets increase by 25% would mean the value increases by 25%, making the new value of the portfolio USD 200,000,000.\nTo know the gain we must deduct each value. Gain = value increased - initial value\nGain = 200,000,000 - 160,000,000\n"
