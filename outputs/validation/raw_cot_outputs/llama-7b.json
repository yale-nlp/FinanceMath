If your calculation is correct, you should have the same final number(close to 360k) as me. I sliced the numbers and did the calculation different ways. I think it's also logical.\n\nComment: Completely wrong, if you are mentioning \"in C$\" this question must be entirely related to Canada. The \"fair value\" is fair value for all IFRS friends because it's a standardized value.\n\nComment: you should do some research and see if the \"fair value\" is same for all IFRS accounting statements that include \"fair value\". If you find the same fair value in all then you will say \"I am right\". If you can't find the same fair value for all, then I hope you don't copy my answer\n\nAnswer: You will need to use the following steps.\n\nLet the loss be equal to 'L', then:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Calculate the carrying value of equipment, $500,000.\n\\item Calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, $450,000.\n\\item Calculate fair value, $480,000.\n\\item Find the expected values of the cash flows per Cash Flow component.

The sum of (3) and (7) and the final estimate of present value is the impairment loss. (I don't find out why the fair value is two times more expensive with cost of sales and what's might be the effect)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou can run the same process \"hen the loss is equal to 'H'\", for example, or take an alternate method, but this process as a prior"

So I did nothing) 12% to the cost is considered overhead (yes it is arbitrary however company wants to make 10% profit therefore whatever multiple of the cost is accepted 12% is a good value to use. 12% is considered fixed cost which might be different from company’s opinion however the system stays process to calculate the number (there is no other number to estimate therefore this 12% is chosen as the closest possible number to the cost). Months older will make the lead cost go down by 12%. Multiply 15*0.88 to get ₤13. Some toys already existed in October thus it is called end stock. If outside the shop, the led time goes down by ₤13/15 which is considered to do something to lower the overhead(I choose ₤13 to be the minimum so Jan and Feb are not lost sales, also assumed that a lot of competitions are not available would lower the sales in Dec.)\n\nWe all know people prefer good looking toys hence probably need to purchase the toy when it is first available even if it is at higher cost. Similarly, people do not buy toy in August or May because there is more choice in August and May which attracts people. There might be another reason related to seasons"

Formally you use 30 while writing the final answer, but most people put a pen at the point and write either 30 or $30.\n\\item Intrinsic value is what you would have if the stock price was $0. The value in the market  is not the value of intrinsic.\n\\item The interest rate is 0.058 or 5.8 percent. Usually people write the percentage just like \"half percent\". One percent is about equal to \"one point\". The exact amount in fractions would be: x/100\n\\item The live assurance group says that it is not reflecting in the stock price. So the stock price of the assurance group is just 5.80 percent over the issue par value. And 1 (par value) is 5.8 in percentage.\n\\item The preferred stock of the group has a 5.80 percent interest. While the specified one launching by the group has a 5 percent great annual return. So doesn't have a separate interest rate for other. Let's include both interest rates to the percentage:x/90 + (5/100). Remember the rule, the interest rate on the specified (exactly 5.80) is lower/before/exceeding 5 percent of a annual return return/anticipated/ on the same/affected certificate. Since that specified stock would be classified/a different category-type regardless of the actual intention/training/ demand/ desire/ under the common law tax principle[1]. The stock of the group would get a higher interest rate because the specified stock has also an exceeding 5 percent rate of return.\n\\item So the answer is x/90 + (5/100).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: I think Step 2 above is incorrect as the market intrinsic value is not the same as the interest paid on the bond. The market intrinsic value is the implicit forward value of the bond based on the current expected return to the current forward price. This is not linear. Normally, it's around $MVS/60. In this form of words, if you believe that R is one point (100bp on a $30 bond), you can work out that the market"

Then you need to figure out how much the operations provided as how the entire cost reflected. It had 250+70+50=$370 which then needs to be divided by the ending amount. The answer would then be $370/81,250 or $0.004428055. Then you need to multiply the answer by 3(how often you spread out the cost of operations), and then you have answer of $0.001431145. This then needs to be added with the initial amount you produce which is $41,200. So everything should start from $0. Since July is the beginning of the period, we need to check which of the 3 prices should be used to process the gross profit July. The price on June 12 is used to ask about the gross profit. It needs to be paid upon on July 1 and by July 28, the average of the amount is $6.83 and the gross profit could be calculated by using the formula 'Starting amount minus Two prices compared*Total units. The answer of this formula is 50*2(cost of unit)*(450-115+285). The answer could then be $144,210.

Therefore, there is a growth rate(plus)0.06/1.72=$3,6%\nAnd furthermore if you calculate the CAPM of 10% over 3 years, the determined stock rate is -14.92. We already have the fact that the stock rate is -14.92. Therefore we need to multiply the present capital value (the price is $54.15) and the rate -26,96 times $54.15 - CAPPM of 10% and you get your risk-free capital value $32.50\nNow there is one number missing: the equation for the dependency of the growth rate of the dividend. Because we know the perpetuity and the optimal growth rate it can be determined thus. Alternatively we know already our growth rate over the 3 years. To compare, logarithmic means a continuous growthand the rate of growth is definetly storage. Therefore the growth rate amounts to the logarithmic of the dividend. The slice of the generated dividends is (logarithmic)2*1.77. The exponential exponent of this slice is a multiplication of the logarithmic with 1/3 (this times 1.72). The Fibonacci functions multiply the result with three. That's why the necessary dividend growth rate amounts to e1.72*0.06/3 = 2,09%. Approximately this is the result. But as you know, there is dividend yield involved. The approximate yield is (1-Markett/Div%)^(1/3). Altogether the dividend amounts to 3,11. By multiplying the stock rate with this dividend growth rate of 2,09% and our dividend yield 3,11% the equivalent rate evolves 15.12% or 15,113,7%\n\nComment: If you have a solution, you should write it in your question as the solution.

You can deduct from 360 months to get the value. 0 is June, last month is January.\n\nThe second is, what are the interest rates assuming in this case? They are 12 times dollars return to the issuer. In order to get the spot rate until 12 months, you need to divide the 360 by months multiplied by months respectively. Meaning the first year is 3.6%, the second year is 3.7% and the third year is 3.8%.\n\nNote, when you use the spot rate, you are assumed the payments are at close to year end (I forget the exact date, maybe 35 days before year end), so you can't use the period as your annual payment unless you are sure this is right. 3.6% rate at the beginning of each month is not spot\n etc.\n\n\\begin{code}\nAnswer = 360,12,1000,0.05,360/12*12*1,360/12*12*2,360/12*12*3 = 77.769212\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: The 0.05 is the coupon rate.

A conversion-rate simply means how many shares a bond can turn into if you pay the bond holders 100% of the stock price at the conversion.\nConvertible bonds are rebated from their face value when they are converted into ordinary shares. Furthermore, a conversion into ordinary shares does not increase the total share capital.\nIn this question, the face value of each common stock is $1 ( 1,000,000 / 100).\nIf we multiply the face value of the common stock with the conversion rate, we can reflect the resulting stock capital. This amount is $100 when multiplied with the conversion rate of 300 shares.\nConvertible bonds can be converted into 300,000 ordinary shares, which means the conversion rate is 3,000 from one convertible bond into ordinary sharing which amounts to a stock capital of $300,000.\nAdding both, the stock capital equals the net income ($1,500,000) - net of the principal product value - divided by the earning-per-share-factor.\nThe diluted earning-per-share-factor does not change, but the number of shares has to change to account for the convertible securities. To show the full picture, the number of shares has to be multiplied by the conversion rate and ought to be added to the common stock.

            " Business-related knowledge about depreciation and how to calculate are not required.\n\n0. The first step to answer the question is to understand what units-of-production approach refers to.\n\n1. Numeric value of depreciation expense in the initial year = (Cost - Residual value) / Expected production in the first year = $500,000/150,000 = $3.33/car.\n\n2. $3.33/car means the annual depreciation expense of 1 unit of equipment is around $3.33. So, since the unit number expected to produce in the first year to depreciate is 150,000 = total annual production, the number of units to be produced in the first year is\n500,000/3.33/150,000 = 279335.\n\n3. It is the number of units' production that has to be done in the first year that we need to calculate in the last step. However, it is the number of units that production is expected to do after the first year. Then what units would be produced after the first year?\nAssume they produce 950,000 units in the first year to depreciate approximately 150,000 units of equipment. And to depreciate the equipment in the next year, estimate the production by assuming the accumulated depreciation during the first year. With any capacity, there is a linear relationship between production and accumulated depreciation when using the units-of-production approach. Also see how accumulated production and accumulated depreciation are related in the next table.\n|id |\n|0  |150,000 units  |\n|1  |(accumulated depreciation) |\n|D=150 x 150 = 22,500,000|\n\n.\n\n4.

We have no any information about the salvage value of the software development. We need to predict the closing value at the end of 2014. By the Johnson Company principles we can conclude the software development should be sold for $16 million in the end of 2014. So it's expected to close at the $10,000 while the software development should sell for $16,000.\n\nAnswer: A. Since the \"Salvage value\" has not been specified (since this is placed on the land for depositing (yet)), we will assume its being equal to zero.\n\nB. Using the LIFO method of streaming amortization, we will adjust the book value at \"equipment\" of 320,000 inventory and amortize using the discount rate of 6% we receive. Let's use 2/12 as example (since the following is computed at a later \"time period\"). Discount accordingly otherwise (0, 1/5, 1/6, 1/12, 2/12) represents the amortization period.\n\nSince current periods are 12 months long, the service/ amortization period of the equipment is lengthened to a 5 year period (512 paid months). Which is then discounted accordingly.\nSince the last (but one) I/S is 0, we would use the \"remaining\" 17 months to value the asset. Thus you end up with a range $(248,280)$. Copyright will always be demonstrable hence renders volunteers useless. However, this would also increase the research written off.

Since, we dont have the definition of current sales, we can just assume the current sales and sum up the revenue of units change from 250 units.

Therefore, it can be expressed as (sales-direct costs)/ fixed cost, (total product revenue – total product fixed costs)/ fixed cost.If we start from a certain level of sales, we divide both sides by total product fixed costs, we can get the degree of operating leverage, or DOL(sales-direct costs)/ fixed cost.

We weighted by the beginning unit cost and get 32.5(1000/1700) unit cost. In conclusion we get an ending average cost of 75+(73.5-70)*32.5=78.375 unit. Therefore in 2014, the ending inventory is 2000*75 - 1500*78.375=4472.65 unit.\n\n\\begin{code}\n require 'vbssqlite3'\n\n db = SQLITE3.Database('item.db')\n q = db.createQuery(\"select item, unit as cost, amount, itemUnit as ItemsSold From Item where cost <= ?? and itemUnit > ? order by itemUnit\")\n q.register_callback(fun(cursor)\n  cursor.execute()\n  for r in cursor do\n    if r.amount >0 then\n      Reading[r.item] = r.currentUnit/r.cost*100\n      Reading[r.item] = Reading[r.item] + r.currentUnit\n    end\nend, [\"${upper("

            " The total return stated in the problem statement is from the beginning of the year. The beginning value of the XYZ stock would be the price to be determined. It's more efficient to finish several time period results one at a time and sum them up at the end.\n\nIn this first time period, the stock price should go up by a percentage stated in the problem statement if there's positive market return. If there's no positive market return, the price should go down by a percentage stated in the problem statement.\nTo find or estimate the possible future price at time point 1, the following formulas can be applied. If the return is not stated in percentage form, the return can be related to another form of interest formula such as interest rate or annual compounded interest rate.\nPrice to be paid for 1 period is: average price, capital invested plus expected return over 1 period times1-period.\nWhere: average price is market price minus average selling price. Capital invested is beginning market value minus shares initially purchased.\nWhen there’s a positive market return, it will directly affect the price to be paid for 1 period – equal to the value stated in the problem statement.\nWhen there’s not positive market return, the price will go down in proportion to a percentage stated in the problem statement.\nSo, the possible price at the beginning of period 1 plus the current price at the beginning of period 1 is the ending the market value of XYZ stock at period 2.\nThis is expected return at period 1, and the ending market price “x” can be calculated as above. Therefore, the future value of every mutual fund is the one that can track roughly the total value of the individual stock that comprises it. The key is to tap into with which companies you should get into the mutual fund.\nFinally, we should summarize return for every period, and put them together to get the final total return for the entire period.\n\nSimilarly, Find the final total return for the entire time period stated in the problem statement.\nWrite calssical answee section\n\nComment: Why have people up-voted this?

Since the BE was $120k and current operating cost subtracted would be $15k, the BE is $105k. If we assume that the operating cost is not only fixed and will stay with the company, we can multiply the operating cost per unit to the sales to see that revenue per unit is $10500*500 = $525,000.\n\nWe divide Operating Cost by Revenue, which is the margin. Since we think this number is probably small, we approximated the % margin by multiplying the Revenue per unit by 10% in order to be 'very close' We believe 10% of 525k is correct. If there is retain or fixed cost, and assume these cost are also small, we believe the net profit margin is 20% of 525k.

That means, what he can use is just financial capital.\nNow, Peter has $$$3,200,000$$$. He must withdraw $$$1,080,000$$$ because $$$2,120,000$$$ is still in human capital.

How? Hamilton, in his tax tables, teaches us that there isn't true taxes on human capital, but in order to incentivize this diversification we need to give back capital gain taxes on any investment made into human capital.\nExample: A and B decided to invest $$$1,000,000$$$ each into human capital.

What would be the effect on 2014 net-profit of a LIFO to FIFO transition? Net is equal to 34,178. Lower sales are matched by higher inventories, locked at P&L. Ending LIFO reserve is produced by operating losses. If total reversal is reversed in 2014 the answer would be different from if in 2013 but same in any other year. Tax rate translates this reversal anyway. The only analysis needed here are the unit variables and see for what the transformations in sales, inventories and financial position would mean for net profit.\n\nAnswer: I think your logic is correct, though we would need more information to gather the actual accuracy.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Sales: Increases by $27M ($12M more for product cost in dollar terms and $15M more for inventory) before taxes.\n\\item Inventory: 16.8% comes from pulling of ending LIFO reserve at FIFO ($82M) before taxes. 3.2% from other inventory costs before taxes ($82M/(2125-280)). Total inventory cost per dollar of ending sales is $58.8M/$2125 - $280 = $28.91/$783.38\n\\item Ending LIFO reserve at FIFO = $46/2125 = $0.0216/product.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFinancial Position:  Increase asset end LIFO reserve by $82M before taxes. $82M goes into ending inventory and $?.?.?M is ending LIFO reserve.

The dividends in our calculation are the final dividend option price. then we can use EOM(DFSP/rate), because there are many annual dividends for the stock price.

The 7% discount rate comes from the beta of 1.35, which is the average beta of proxies of US equities between 1962 and 2003 that Allison had been using for her past estimates for long-term average equity returns.\n\n2) If the discount rate is 7% (the CAPM), then the expected return on the S&P 500 is (0.07)(1.35), or 9.95%. Therefore, your revised answer is 9.95%.\n3) If she is supplementing her forecast with the CAPM then further reduce the forecasted return to 9.60% due to small ρ, so forecast 9.60%.\n4) Now let's use behavioral modeling.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item First ignoring the difference in risk between Treasury and equity betas (which probably is not large), ρ should the actual betas of those two portfolios. You can use this part of the paper: \\em{Note that differences in risk across the bonds component of the S&P 500 score lower than the equity component, and Saez and Stapletonheim basically believe the betas are not different because they don't adjust the betas for the difference in risk. We don't recommend using overall betas when you're not sure whether betas are different across the components of the S&P 500. Six additional regressions, average betas abroad the equity component being 1.07 and minimum of -0.7 and maximum of 1.1, were consistent with this interpretation.} In the end, she agrees that ρ is about 0.6 and betas should go about 1.25.\n\\item But we believe that the insufficient estimates for the beta of equity vs. Treasury bonds was in the past. Thus she should estimate the beta separately for equities and diversified bonds. However, we are not going to answer it right now. For later reading see this paper"

Now, let's take the defectives vehicles number of arrivals. It follows the the Poisson distribution 'defectives_vehicles_number ~ Poisson(5%)*0.05'. I am always told if you want to solve a Poisson problem, you need to hasten to '<hat> f(x+1) = u<hat>.Vp(), where x is the arrival number, u is the arrival number of the prospective vehicle, and Vp() is the probability when the prospective vehicle passes the quality inspection.' However, this seems to differ substantially from the Beauty Queens' problem. Then, I write 'defective_vehicles_percentage ~ Poisson(5%)*0.05', we solve it with 'v.defectives.number = u.defectives.number * defective_vehicles_percentage + def.vehicle_number.number'. Because there are conducted inspections one by one when you are selecting vehicles, there are vehicles that pass the inspection unconditionally in the pool of vehicles on production line but they are defective, so there are some malfunctions which cannot be detected easily.\n\nTo sum up, I try to solve the answer by using the following distributions:\nDue to the condition that we need to randomly pick 5 vehicles on the production line, we solve it using '100 * u.number.number / sum(u.number.number)`, which corresponds to the formula '100 * v.defectives.number / sum(v.defectives.number) + nondefective_vehicle_number.number.`\n\nComment: The math is completely missing from this Q&A.\n\nComment: Please clarify (I'm not a native speaker of English as well): \"because there are conducted inspections one by one when you are selecting vehicles.\" Why is this only applicable to 5 random choices of the pool?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the numbers are correct, though a bit simplified (no spellout of probabilities, use of lower case for random variables).\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Generate 100 random numbers in the"

            "\nFirst, find bond price.\nWe put 8%, because it is the coupon of this bond. It is a non-callable, which means that company can't pay back money before maturity date.\nWe use the formula:\n\"Price = Bond bought * (1 + Coupon Rate + (Number of periods of coupon payment * risks premium))\". It is called DDM method. Arg for price, the quantity part means Number of periods of coupon payment * periods until maturity, and it is 20, one period for one period until maturity. In our case it is 20, therefore, quantity part is 20. That means the quantity of quantity part is 40. We still use 1.0594 with currency rate of US dollar to Canadian dollars. It means currency rate of US dollar is 1.0594.\nNow, we write price =1.0594 * 1.0594* 8 * 20. We have 1.0594* 1.0594* 8 * 20 = 1608.822.... The value is rather high. The result of bond is rather high, but in order to think better and easier, we put constant next to calculation of prices. So the price is 1.0594* 1.0594* 8 * 20 / 1.0594.\nIt means that:\n\n\"$1,105.94 = (1.0594* 1.0594* 8 * 20 ) /1.0594 * 1.05948.822 = 81.42287.127....\"\nNow, for next part, find the returns on equity.\nDividend on common stocks can be calculated with the following formula and can be figured by multiplying the number of shares outstanding times the dividend per share times the price per share. For example, if a company has 1 million shares outstanding and a dividend per share of $1.50 and the current stock price is $75, then the dividends for the year would be: $1,000,0"

            "  Question:  If a two-year fixed-for-floating MRR swap is at 1.00%, and the yield of the two-year US Treasury bond is 0.63%, what would be the swap spread?\n1) We know that current two-year US treasury bond yield would be 0.63%.\n2) We know that return on a 2-year fixed for floating swap would be 1.00 so total risk free rate is 1.63%.\n3) Now we want to calculate the credit spread (swap spread) on a two year fixed for floating swap. Since it is pure 2Y risk free swapped with a 2Y fixed rate step forward swap. So we need to use pure 2Y rate on forward swap. 2Y forward rate = 0.5000 as shown in the figure at the bottom.\nNow we need to calculate this 2Y forward swap variables in the formula of swap spread. In formula of swap spread = risk free rate (doubled) - yield. Said another way, swap spread = total risk free rate - swap rate. So, swap spread = 1.63% - 0.5000 = 1.13%. [0.63% dissipates, it is not considered for spread calculation at all].\n\nNext, we understand that credit spread must be negative since 1.91% is obviously the lowest. Else it does not make sense at all since the entire 2Y fixed for floating swap market becomes sudden unavailable at that point for buyers. Now that we know what is the swap spread, there must be a 2Y bond floating rate step forward swap at 1.91%. So, the correct answer is 1.91%.\n\nOur understanding is backed up by by the following 2-year swap curve, in Copyright 2010 by Ted Belder, Illinois State University. Notice how step forward swap exists at 2.00%, and all-in two-year swap is 2.74%."

We can also understand the required rate of return or the required discount rate so we know that it is 20%. Therefore, we just need to skipped to the judging phase.\n\nStep 2: Compute the discount factor. The computation usually looks like this:\n\nTo calculates the correct discount factor, we generally use the Excel Spreadsheet.\nWe can use COVID toolkit to download the Cropped Modellar interest rate data (and also the standard Fed model if we need to handle the short rate forward curve). But it is dangerous and hence, I would just use the Excel with the assumption of 3D security and a horizon of 5 years.\n\nStep 3: Compute the NPV.

            " Computer the standard deviation of investment portfolio not asset is needed. For this, I compute two separate total (i.e. the total percentages weight of both assets X and Y). The standard deviation of one asset would be (just using simple average and square). Then standard deviation of total would be using those two data with right formula. First, we need to calculate the percentage weight of total assets together. Then, right formula can be applied. But how we would find the correlation between assets X and Y. Well, I don't have (or don't know or quite familiar with) a package that calculate the correlation between assets. I have a brief idea for this, but don't know how. I am seeking for the answer from this forum, hoping that someone know about this. Therefore, I don't have the right answer yet.\nSo I see my problem too. I wish I can complete my homework as soon as can but I can't do it for now.\n\n\\begin{code}\n    #\n    # Standard deviation of investment portfolio not asset\n    #\n\n    data = extract(X, Y)\n    N <- length(data)\n    soln = ''\n    delta_x = soln = pmax(((data[1] + data[7] - 1)*3 + data[2]*5 - 3)/2 - data[1]/500, 0)\n\n    delta_y = soln = pmax(((data[3] + data[4] - 1)*3 + data[5]*5 - 3)/2 - data[3]/500, 0)\n\n    total_x = (data[1]+data[3]+data[5] + data[7])/N\n    total_y = (data[2]+data[4]+data[6]+data[8])/N\n\n    dt_X = ((data[1] + data[3] + data[5] + data[7])*data[1] + (data[2] + data[4] + data[6] + data[8])*data[2])/(N*(position(total_x)*total_x + position(total_x)*total_y + position(total_y)*total_y))\n    dt_Y = ((data[1] +"
