The cost to fully secure the position should be the cost to buy back the forward contract plus the cost of purchasing 200,000 Euros at the USD/EUR six-month forward rate. This means the cost is ($200,000 * 1.4260) + ($200,000 * -$26,200) = $4,476,000 + $4,476,000 = $8,952,000.\n3. But the cost to purchase 200,000 Euros at the six months forward rate now (1.4260) is ($200,000 * 1.4260) = $2,812,000. So the cost at this moment is $8,952,000 - $2,812,000 = $6,140,000.\n4.

To fully secure the position, Martinez has to pay $6,140,000 to get back the forward contract plus another $2,812,000 to buy euros so he needs to raise $8,952,000. Since Martinez lost $576,000 on the position, he does not have this amount available. Martinez can only raise $11,520,000 which leaves a gap of $8,952,000 - $11,520,000 = -$1,568,000.\n6. Ignoring turnover costs, the cheapest way to fully secure the position is to enter in a new forward contract to deliver USD and receive Euros six months later at the USD/EUR six months forward rate.

We can use the known fact that for a normal distribution, the area between the mean and any assurance level (e.g., 2.5% for 95% assurance level) is that level.

This is because the price elasticity of demand greater than 1 implies the inverse relationship between the price and the quantity demanded which means by raising the price Yahoo sells less but earns more. Since the average cost is $50, by setting a price which exceeds $50, Yahoo makes a positive profit of $50 - $p. Yahoo maximizes the profit when \n$$p = 50+.5(1.8)(30) = 50+ 15= \\boxed{65}.$$"

            "\nFirstly, we suppose the 1-year interest rate remains at 8.0% in the two-year period. In this case, we will discount the 1-year cash flow with a 8.0% discount rate to valuate the bond, which will result in a valuation of $(1+.08)^{(2)} = 1.24 * 1000 = 1240$.\nThen we need to calculate the expected value of the 1-year interest rate and use it to discount the cash flow. We have $E[(1 + r)^{(1)}] = (1 + \\frac{6}{100} + \\frac{10}{100})^{(1)} = 2.1$. Then we can get $(1+.21)^{(1)} = 1.26$. Finally, we can get the valuation of the bond with two-year term is $(1 + E[r])^{(1)} * $1000 = 1260 under the expected interest rate of 8.01%.\nBy weighted average method, we will get the valuation of the bond is $\\frac{1240}{1+.08} + \\frac{1260}{1+.21} \\approx \\boxed{1246}$."

But that doesn't tell us anything about what proportion of delayed payments are secondary quality loans. Maybe all the delayed payments are secondary quality loans or maybe all the delayed payments are top quality loans. Neither of those would be a 50% chance of it being a secondary quality loan. To solve this, we need to think about the population, or the total collection of loans the researcher is studying. If we take the population of all the loans as our sample space, then we can say that the probability of selecting a secondary quality loan that is delayed is , which is 200 loans out of 1000 + 600 loans, or  We can solve this by setting up a proportion , where  is the number of secondary quality loans that are delayed and  is the total number of secondary quality loans.

Now we have to solve for  which is the number of secondary quality loans out of 1000 + 600 loans, or  Multiplying both sides by  and solving for  gives us  Which means  is 300 loans. Now we have to solve for the proportion of top quality loans that are delayed, which is  Multiplying both sides by  and solving for  gives us  Which means  is 48 loans. Now we have to solve for the probability that a loan that is delayed is a top quality loan, which is  Multiplying both sides by  and solving for  gives us  Which means  is 36.6%.

But we can calculate it in two steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the proportion of the funds return that are below $200,000. There are two cases:\n\nCase 1: The threshold is between the mean and the middle of the interval:\n\nThe proportion of the funds return that are smaller than $200,000 is equal to the area of the normal distribution between minus infinity and $200,000 divided by the area of the normal distribution between minus infinity and $200,000. This is equal to the area of the normal distribution between minus infinity and $160,000 divided by the area of the normal distribution between minus infinity and $200,000. This proportion is equal to Figure 1 divided by Figure 2.\n\nCase 2: The threshold is between the middle of the interval and the mean:\n\nThe proportion of the funds return that are smaller than $200,000 is equal to the area of the normal distribution between minus infinity and $200,000 divided by the area of the normal distribution between $120,000 and $200,000.

This proportion is equal to Figure 1 divided by Figure 3.\n\nThe answer shares the same value with Cases 1 and 2. The proportion of the funds' return that are smaller than $200,000 – the proportion of the funds return that are smaller than $160,000 – the proportion of the funds return that are smaller than $120,000.\n\nThe answer must be a multiple of 25%, so the answer is Case 1 + Case 2 = 100% – 68% – 23% = 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25%."

            " The analyst must first calculate the income available for common stockholders by subtracting the interest owed to bondholders and preferred stockholders from the total income. This is because the bondholders and preferred stockholders must be paid before the common stockholders receive any income.\n\nAs the bonds are convertible into 300,000 shares of stock, their conversion would increase the number of common shares by 300,000. Because the bonds are already convertible, their conversion would result in atoms and molecules, so the bonds are accounted for as a dilutive security in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.The numerator of the basic EPS equation will remain the same, since there were 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding for the entire year. The denominator, however, will increase by 300,000 due to the potentially dilutive effect of the bonds. This results in an estimated earnings per share of $1.5/(1,000,000+300,000) = $0.45/1,300,000 = $0.003/share. Since the analyst must account for the cumulative preferred stock, increase the denominator of the basic EPS equation by an additional 600,000, as there are 600,000 additional shares outstanding from the cumulative preferred stock. The cumulative preferred stock is also a dilutive security, so the earnings per share will be $1.5/(1,000,000+600,000) = $0.45/1,600,000 = $0.002/share. Since the earnings per share of both securities are less than $0.0005, the analyst must use the if-converted method for the cumulative preferred stock. To do this, convert the cumulative preferred stock by multiplying the earnings per share by the conversion ratio, which results in an additional $0.002 per share x 7% = $0.0014/share. Therefore, the diluted EPS is $0.003 + $0.0014 = $0.0017/share. The analyst must then amplify the diluted EPS by the anti-dilution factor of 71%, which is calculated as 1/(1+30%) to account for the corporation's 30% tax rate. The anti-dilution EPS is then $0.0017/share x 71% = $0.001225/share. Therefore, the answer is $0.001225."

It should be CHF100,000 - CHF16,000 = CHF84,000.\nTherefore, the answer is CHF84,000."

The standard deviation of the portfolio \"P\" can be written as the square root of the weighted average of the variance of each security, where the weight is the proportion of the security in the portfolio. Since the correlation of the returns between security 1 and security 2 is 0.40, the correlation of the returns between the portfolio and security 1 (call it \"correlation 1\") would be 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28 (this can be proved by the formula: correlation = cov(A, B) / (σA * σB)). And the correlation of the returns between the portfolio and security 2 (\"correlation 2\") would be 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18. The standard deviation of security 1 is 20%, and that of security 2 is 12%, therefore, the standard deviation of portfolio \"P\" is: √(0.3 * 20^2 + 0.7 * 12^2) = √(840) = √(20.8) = ≈ 21.2.\nAnswer: Therefore, the answer is 21.2."

If this forward contract was made at a price of GBP/EUR 0.7400, the company would have to receive 0.29 + 0.74 = EUR 0.93 per EUR according to the forward contract. Based on the assumption that the firm received EUR 5,000,000 for GBP in the past using a forward contract, if the exchange rate now is GBP/EUR 0.7343 as shown in Exhibit 1, the company would only receive GBP 5,000,000 * 0.7343 =GBP 3,763,300 because the exchange rate has changed. Since the company is supposed to receive GBP 3,763,300 based on the forward contract but will only receive GBP 3,763,300 based on the current exchange rate, the loss caused by the change of exchange rate is GBP 3,763,300 - GBP 3,763,300 * 0.29 = GBP 219,900. Considering that the company will receive EUR 5,000,000 in 3 months, if the EUR/GBP forward rate for the 3 - month term is 4.40/4.55 as shown in Exhibit 2, the company would have to spend GBP 3,763,300 * 4.40 = GBP 16,175,200 to receive EUR 5,000,000 at the maturity.

In summary, the mark-to-market loss of the forward contract is GBP 219,900 as explained before plus the imcoming cash flow of GBP 249,850, the total mark-to-market gain for the forward contract is GBP 219,900 + GBP 249,850 = GBP 469,750."

We can use an average spread of 11bps per year, which is computed as 234 / (3 * 11) .\n\nThe additional yield reduces the bond's present value by this amount, therefore it needs to be deducted again.\n\nPV of the cashflows * ( 1 + 11bps / year average spread ) ^ 3 years\n\nStep 4: Calculate the final value\nAfter all adjustments the present value of the cash flows is now 90.49.\n\nSo the final answer is 90.49."

The default convention is that if the bond's duration is d, its modified duration is m is 1+m = [(1+Yield to Maturity)(1+Yield to Reinvestment)/Yield to Reinvestment] ** d, where Yield to Reinvestment is the yield assumed for reinvestment of the coupon payments. In this example, let's say the bond has a duration of 15. Hence, modified duration is 1.03829 = (1+Yield to Maturity)(1+Yield to Reinvestment)/Yield to Reinvestment ** 15, which means when the Yield to Maturity changes, the bond price will change by Modified Duration * (New Yield to Maturity - Old Yield to Maturity).\nLet's say the Yield to Maturity now is 4% and the projected change is -0.05, the new yield to maturity will be 3.95%. Therefore, the bond price will change by 10.3829 * (-0.05) = -5.1939%.\nSecond, modified convexity helps to measure the second order of sensitivity of bond price with respect to the change in yield. The default convention is that if the bond's convexity is c, its modified convexity is m is 1+m = (Yield to Reinvestment/Yield to Maturity) ** c. In this example, let's say the bond's convexity is 20. Hence, modified convexity is 141.217 = (3.95%/4%) ** 20, which means when the Yield to Maturity changes, the bond price will change by Modified Convexity * (New Yield to Maturity - Old Yield to Maturity) ** 2.\nLet's say the Yield to Maturity now is 4% and the projected change is -0.05, the new yield to maturity will be 3.95%. Therefore, the bond price will change by 141.217 * (-0.05 * -0.05) = -7.0688%.\nSince modified convexity measures the second order of sensitivity, the impact of yield change will be bigger than modified duration when expressed in percentage.

If Serene issues up to $2.5 million of new bonds, they will be priced at par and will have a yield of 13.65%; but if they issue bonds beyond $2.5 million, the entire issuance is expected to yield 16%. Since the total amount of bond Serene seeks is $7.5M, we expect the cost of new bond issuance will be $(2.5+7.5)\\times 0.2\\times 0.3 = $1.125M if Serene issues $2.5M bonds; and $(7.5-2.5+7.5)\\times 0.4\\times 0.3 = $2.2M if Serene issues $7.5M bonds.\nSecond step, we need to compute the cost of equity. Since Serene has 1.2 million common shares outstanding, the new common stock issuance will increase the number of shares to 1.2 + 0.075 = 1.225 million. Thus, the cost of new common stock issuance is $10 \\times 0.075 = $0.75M. The total cost of new equity issuance is thus $0.75 + $1.125 = $2.25M. The market value of equity will be increased from $12M to $12 + $2.25 = $14.25M after the new issuance.\nThird step, we need to compute the new debt-to-equity ratio. The new debt will be $7.5 - $1.125 = $5.625M if Serene issues $7.5M bonds. The new debt-to-equity ratio will be 40% if Serene issues $2.5M bonds and 50% if Serene issues $7.5M bonds.\nStep four, we estimate the new weighted average cost of capital. Since Serene secures $7.5 million of new funding while keeping the same debt-to-equity ratio, we can estimate the new WACC by assuming the company issues $2.5M bonds and $5.625M new debt, and issue $0.75M new equity. We can take the average cost of debt and equity as the cost of the new debt and equity mix. The cost of debt is 5.625/14.25 = 0.4. The cost of equity is 2"

If his human capital is 25% similar to stocks, and he has $1.2M of it, then it's 25% invested in stocks, which is $300,000. Let's determine Peter's desired allocation for stocks based on his financial capital. Peter has $600,000 of financial capital, so he wants to allocate $600,000 * .3 = $180,000 to stocks. He has $300,000 invested in stocks through his human capital, so he needs to allocate an additional $180,000 - $300,000 = $-90,000 to stocks in his financial capital. His financial capital should be allocated 25% to stocks, or $.25 * $600,000 = $150,000. Therefore, the answer is $150,000."

Since the main purpose of this question is to calculate the cost of this annuity, you can solved this problem in another way around, which is let the amount you invested today be $90,909 and figure out how much annual return you can get. The annual return is $100,000 / $90,909 = 1.1105, so the YTM is 1.1105 - 1 = 5.5%. Therefore, the answer is 5.5%."

If we multiply the multiplier's value by 1.375, it now amounts to $187.5 million. We can say the stock index is now worth $187.5 million * 200% = $375 million. Now we need to find out how much money needs to be allocated in the stock index. If we do 375/600*80, we find that the stock allocation needs to be 55%. This means we need to change the allocation from 80% to 55%, so we need $100 million * (55% - 80%) =  $20 million less in the stock index. We can now multiply $20 million by the multiplier to find out how many stock index futures we need to buy which is $20 million * $250 / $1,200,000 = 16. Therefore, we need to buy 16 stock index futures."

In other words, it measures the sensitivity of the firm's assets to market movements.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the expected return on assets (or the alpha) of the business, which is the weighted average of the expected returns on the firm's individual assets, where the weights are the market values of the assets.\n\nThe expected return on assets of the firm (or alpha) can be expressed as:\n\nα = w1 * (r1 - d1) + w2 * (r2 - d2) + ··· + wn * (rn - dn)\n\nwhere w1, w2, ..., wn are the market values of the assets, r1, r2, ..., rn are the expected returns on the assets, and d1, d2, ..., dn are the corresponding costs of debt for each asset.\n\nIn this case, the market value of the assets is equal to the total value of the firm, which is 60% financed by debt, or V = 0.6 * F. Thus, the expected return on assets is:\n\nα = w * (r - d)\n\n= 0.6 * (r - d)\n\nwhere r is the expected return on market and d is the cost of debt.\n\nFinally, combining everything together, we can express the asset beta of the business as:\n\nβa = Cov(α, r) / Var(α)\n\n= Cov(0.6 * (r - d), r) / Var(0.6 * (r - d))\n\n= 0.6 * Cov(r - d, r) / Var(0.6 * (r - d))\n\n= 0.6 * σ(r - d) / 0.6 * σ2(r - d)\n\n= σ(r - d) / σ2(r - d)\n\n= 1\n\nThus, the asset beta of the business is 1, which means that the assets have the same beta as the market."

The number of stock index futures needed can be calculated as follows: Bonds component : Currently, the bond component is worth $20 million, which represents 20 / 100 * $100m = 20% of the total portfolio. If we assume that the term to maturity of the bond futures is the same as the existing bonds, we can calculate the value of the bonds component after the transaction as: New bonds component : Since “the value of the stock index stands at 1,200” and the multiplier of the stock index futures is $250, each stock index future is worth 1,200 * 250 = $300,000. So the cost of the bonds component after the transaction will be: New bonds component cost : Since the cost of one bond futures agreement is $105,300 and we have to buy enough agreements to cover the bonds component that is now worth $20m, the total cost of the new bonds component will be 20m * 105,300 / 300,000 = $714,000. Let's shift the focus to the shares component. Currently, the shares component is worth $80m, which represents 80 / 100 * $100m = 60% of the total retirement fund. If we assume that the beta of the new bonds component will be equal to the one of the existing shares component (which is a very conservative assumption), we can calculate the beta of the new shares component as: Beta of new shares component : Currently, the beta of the shares component is 1.2 * 80 / 60 = 1.6. If we buy stock index futures, the beta of the shares component will decrease. To keep things simple, let's assume that the beta of the shares component will be equal to the beta of the new bonds component (1.6). Then, we can calculate the value of the new shares component as: New shares component : The value of the shares component currently is $80m and we want to decrease this to $40m, which represents 40 / 100 * $100m = 40%.

The future contract has a daily variance of 600,000(0.12)2 /2 = $24,000, where 0.12 is the annual volatility of XYZ divided by the square root of 252 (the number of trading days annually).

The deep in-the-money call options have a daily variance of ($5-$4)2(5000)(200,000 / 2) / $4 / $5 = $48,000.

We can treat the two-year swap as two one-year swaps, and assume the fixed-for-floating swap will exchange fixing\nin value at the beginning of year 2. The value of the fixed-for-floating swap at the beginning of year 2 would be the sum of the value of two one- year swaps. With the fraction of the first year being 1 / 2, so the value of the first one-year swap is\n2 * notional / 2 * time * fix - float = notional * fix - float.

We are given the zero-coupon bonds are priced at $10, so their face values are $10*total amount of years till maturity/year, so the first bond's face value is $10*(1 year)/year = $10, the second bond's face value is $10*(9 years)/year = $90. The total face value of the portfolio is $10 + $90 = $100. The weighting of each bond is the inverse of their face value, so the first bond's weight is $10/$100 = 1/10, the second bond's weight is $90/$100 = 9/10.\nNow let's move to the next step. We know the Modified Duration is a measure of the average time to cash flow, so the sensitivity of the cash flows to a parallel shift in the yield curve can be calculated by the formula: New Price = Old Price * (maturity / average time to cash flow). Thus, we can use this formula to calculate the originally expected cash flows for each bond based on the provided information. The first bond's cash flow is $10 * (1 year / 1 year) = $10; the second bond's cash flow is $90 * (9 years / 9 years) = $90.\nLet's assume a parallel shift in the yield curve happens and the new yield is 4.5%, so we can use the above formula to calculate the new cash flow for each bond. The new cash flow for the first bond is $10 * (1 year / 0.5 year) = $20; the new cash flow for the second bond is $90 * (9 years / 4.5 years) = $80.\nLet's use the maximum fund value approach (aka. duration-based approach) to estimate the portfolio's VAR. The Sharpe ratio (SR) of the portfolio, according to the geometric average approach, is: [($80 + $20) / 2] / $100 = 40 / 100 = 0.4, which means the standard deviation of daily fund value is 0.2 with a 5% confidence level. According to the equations for the maximum fund value approach, the portfolio's duration is 7 / 2 = 3.5 (the first bond's duration * the second bond's weight + the second bond's duration * the first bond's weight), the daily VAR at the 95% confidence level is 1.96"
