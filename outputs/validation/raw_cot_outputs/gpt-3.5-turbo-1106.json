Based on this information, what would Firm B’s return on equity be using year-end equity with the ending shareholders’ equity being £10,000,000, a tax rate of 25%, £0.00 in dividends, and a net income of £750,000?",

        "question": "Analyst Johnson is determining the RAROC of a commercial loan portfolio for Company P. He has gathered the following details: The primary borrowing is $1.3 billion. The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues. Based off the definition of RAROC, what would Johnson's prediction about RAROC be?",

Given that the defect rate is 5% and the expected number of defectives in 5 vehicles is 0.05*5 = 0.25, we can use the Poisson distribution to calculate the probability. The formula for the Poisson distribution is P(x; μ) = (e^-μ * μ^x) / x!, where μ is the average rate and x is the number of successes. Plugging in the values, P(1; 0.25) = (e^-0.25 * 0.25^1) / 1! = (0.7788 * 0.25) / 1 = 0.1947. Therefore, the answer is 0.1947."

Since the options are deep in-the-money, they have low sensitivity to changes in the stock price, resulting in a low VaR.\n\nFor the deep out-of-the-money call options, the VaR is relatively higher due to their high sensitivity to changes in the stock price.\n\nFor the future contracts, the VaR is straightforward to calculate using the formula: VaR = (Stock Price) * (Volatility) * (Z-score), where the Z-score for a 99% confidence level is 2.33.\n\nAfter calculating the VaR for each component, we can sum them up to find the total portfolio VaR.\n\nTherefore, the 1-day 99% VaR of the portfolio is $22,628."
