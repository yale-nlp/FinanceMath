            "To maximize profits, Omega Petroleum Corp. will set the price at the point where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). Because this firm is a monopolist, the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve due to the downward-sloping demand curve. The profit maximizing price maximizes the distance between the average cost (AC) curve and the average revenue (AR) curve. At this point, the price elasticity of demand is 1. Since we know the price elasticity of demand (Ed) is 1.5, and Ed = (P/Q)*(dQ/dP), we also know that a 1% increase in price leads to a 1.5% decrease in quantity demanded. We can use this information to solve for the profit-maximizing price (P). If P/Q is 1/1.5, then P = Q/1.5. We also know that MR = P*(1 + 1/Ed) = P*2.5. We can use the fact that MC = MR to solve for P. Substituting Q/1.5 for P in the MR equation: Q/1.5 * 2.5 = 40. Solving for Q: Q = 60. Substituting Q = 60 back into P = Q/1.5: P = 60/1.5.

Next, multiply the maturity price by the present value factor to find the present value of the future delivery price. Subtract the present value of the coupons and the present value of the future delivery price from the cash price of the bond to find the cost of carry. Finally, multiply the cost of carry by the conversion factor by the number of days since the last coupon payment. Add this amount to the cash price of the bond to arrive at the futures price. Therefore, the answer is 128.96."

Average total assets = (Beginning + Ending equity) ÷ 2 = (£10,000,000 + £10,000,000) ÷ 2 = £10,000,000. Net income + Depreciation = Return on Equity x Average Total Assets, thus Return on equity = (1,000,000 + 100,000) ÷ 10,000,000 = 0.11. Since firms A and B have the same equity, operations, and tax rate, they will have the same earnings before taxes and net income. Thus, Firm B's return on equity = 0.11. Therefore, the answer is 0.11."
