            "\n\nStep 1, Actual cost: First, we need to find the actual historical cost of truck in question. Actual historical cost will be calculated as: historical cost at purchase (57,000) - historical cost of distribution at sales (i.e. Land = 21,000) + salvage value when sold (27,000) - salvage value when acquired (15,000). Therefore, actual historical cost = 57,000 - 21,000 + 27,000 - 15,000 = 58,000\nStep 2, Depreciation expense: Second we need to find the depreciation expense when sold 3 years later. To find depreciation expense, use CASHFLOW( Accountants/Legacy/Cashflow/cost_of_goods_sold_formula.js, \"++ - Depreciation\", accountants.reverse executing cost flow accountants.reverse) on the accounts table in the financials dataset.\n\nAfter querying, you will find a depreciation expense of 16,800 for year 2012.11.01 which is the closing date of fiscal year 2012. Remember that we need to get the depreciation expense up to the date when the truck was sold (i.e., 2013.10.31). So right now our depreciation expense = 16,800 (for year 2-4).\n\nLet's now calculate the depreciation corresponding to the truck's period of ownership. To calculate that, we need to apply declining balance depreciation for truck owned 3 years highest depreciation occurs in the first year. In the first year depreciation is 20% * (1 - 0.20)^0 * 57000 = 37760. They sold the truck in year 4 so the depreciation for year 3 is 20% * (1 - 0.20)^1*(1-0.20)^0 * 57000 = 23168.

Then, we believe the companys investing capability is the most valuable for any enterprises.

Eventually you'll come to a mathematical formula, but we can't see even that. Please [edit] and add a compact formula that you're supposed to solve. You can request the answer, but you can't request computers to solve (parts of) humanities problems as given in human language for you.\n\nAnswer: The problem requires knowledge of how you determine the LIFO ending balance, called on the balance sheet. Other people with much smarter/larger/funnier computers than me [have written in detail](http://accountingexplained.com/financial/inventory/lifo) about [LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO). The link says LIFO is not FIFO plus or minus a constant. And indeed, I hope I learn something if anyone is ever able to nicely show LIFO/FIFO as a variant only on initial stock and profit. Now, I can't.\n\nHowever, at least for this particular example, you can invoke the advice that:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nAs of 2011, only 3 percent of responding businesses were using LIFO (last in, first out) accounting.

But, I do not know how we can get the answer.\n\nCould you please give me a high level hint to complete the solution?\n\nAnswer: Without having detailed course materials or lecture notes to consult, here are some thoughts:\n\n1.  I assume from the wording of the question that we are comparing two samples of a normally distributed population.  Since the samples are each normally distributed the estimates of variance are the sample variances 200^2 / 25 = 1600 and 185^2 / 18 = 1710.875.  I base this on the typical definition of variance as F^2 / n.  Here F is sample mean and n is sample size.\n\n2.  Since they are sample variances they (like the sample means) each have (relatively) large standard errors around the true variance.  Addition of two (relatively small) variances (2 chi square distributed values) of unequal magnitudes will certainly not be greater than (or equal to) 2678 because of the standard deviation effects built into the chi square distribution. Therefore there must be (at least) a few more parameters at work here that you haven't revealed. Are there weights that are part of the t-test and the variance comparisons?  The weights could be 25/43 and 18/43, making them not independent.\n\n3. Work from home shows that the Pr[t > 0.745556] centered at 185 and with 17 sd"

            "\n\nFirstly, By Matan's Formula, we know that\n\n```\nAdjusted Length = Duration * Sweep Rate;\n```\n\nFor a zero-coupon bond, we have\n\n```\nSweep Rate = f(y)/(y * (1+y)^n);\n```\n\nTherefore, given a period of 7.020 and a convexity of 65.18, we can easily calculate the\nlifetime, n, which is the number of periods from today to maturity.\n\nFor example:\n\n9 periods to maturity, or 9 * 12 = 108 months.\n10 periods to maturity, or 10 * 12 = 120 months.\n11 periods to maturity, or 11 * 12 = 132 months.\n\nThe answer, unfortunately, is neither of these. Your task is to\nfind n exactly, and then output what the p (or percentage\nchange in price) of this is, at 0.25% downward shift in a-rates. We\nneed to view this as a percentage change in e-rates.\n\nComment: math is off-topic here, see https://math.stackexchange.com/\n\nAnswer: You can try like this\n\n\\begin{code}\nfunction adjusted_period = go(X,Y)\r\n% calculates the adjusted promment in years, assuming discount bonds\r\n% calculation of fiscal periods: Period = Adjusted_Period/r\r\n% fitted output range: 0.000  - 100.000 years\r\n%\r\n% Usage: X = a, mm-yy\r\n%        Y = b\r\n%\r\n% where \r\n%     a: price or par value expressed in cents\r\n%     b: bond duration expressed in years\r\n%     c: aDV at Estimated (Average) Life as a percentage of the nominal value,\r\n%        expressed in percent or as fraction of 100\r\n%     d: period of yield curve, expressed in years\r\n%     e: convexity of yield curve, as a percentage of 100\r"

This is a very common graph charted when you're calculating yield on a price of convexity slab.\nNow, you can roughly estimate the formula by looking at the changes between the points. e.g. yield for a 100 bond for PV0 is 1bp. and the yield for PV+ is 3 bp. so the slope of the line is 2 bps. this means that the formula yields to the slope of 2 bps for every point of a 100 bond price. So, it's better to divide 2 by 100 i.e. 0.02 to have it in ∆yield = ∆ PV/PVf(Y) form.\nBut we still don't know what formula it would be to calculate it on a yield curve.\nNow, you would simply replace PV0 with price to get an approximate formula like this. Right here is where you substitute 99.41172 into the formula at Yield=-1 bp and approximately estimate your curve value:\n58%. Now you need to guess what it is. It can be better calculated by plugging other bond prices. i.e. when P"

However, this does not apply to the above question. Pls explain why.\n\nComment: Some keywords: Strathdee definition of modified duration, effective duration, forward rate curve, parallel shift. I'd suggest you add these keywords.\n\nAnswer: The question is asking for the Duration gap, before-and-after Financial Markets.\n\nHave a look at the Strathdee definition of DUration\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_duration\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhere d is the period of evaluation, N is the time to maturity of the bond, and c(y) is the yield of the bond at time y\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nand evaluate (1) for both scenarios (before + after new Financial Markets open). The difference between the two evaluations is our Duration gap.\n\nThis kind of stuff is interesting because you don't need to know the answer (rather than learning the answer cold as a throwaway takehome-or-class problem) to understand or calculate the answer. For example, the strathdee's definition didn't give the answer, you had to evaluate (1), which was a new thing for you and demonstrated understanding of modified duration. This is not the only path to take to the solution, and the easy answer is not necessarily the right approach for your problem.\n\nThe standard way to quantitatively approach this situation is through effective duration. Since we are looking for difference between h=N and h=N-H, the duration/convexity formula (effective duration equation), though correct in this case, is not advantageous. Using (1) from the wikipedia article is perfectly fine and usable in practice. In theory these speeds up computation for large portfolios substantially.\n\nComment: thanks. I am not familiar with Strathdee definition of modified duration, effective duration, forward rate curve or parallel shift. Can you please elaborate more how to solve the question? What is D = (1+y)^h-(1+m^h)/(h*m)?\n\nAnswer: The answer is 1.0"

Liquidation payment can be different and less than the outstanding bond.\nConclusion, imagine that bond has three different portfolios, within these three portfolios, fixed payments also have different liquidity times. For those with longer liquidity times, you need to calculate outstanding principle times (1+r) to next fixed price period and multiply times the corresponding outstanding value, the result of you is potentially another outstanding value. You need to calculate this those results from  to next fixed price period, the last item is the liquidation value for that portfolio. Those payments between different periods are independent, those from same period can be stacked up or added together.\n\nAnd you need to solve the interdependence between three portfolios.

However, if we compute P(B) here, you need to know if P(B) is the base conditional probability. Therefore, P(B) is 0.2 which is the answer that I think is correct.\n\nCan someone explain to me how to compute P(B) since it was not given in the question? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks for your help in advance.\n\nComment: Can you explain clearly what is the question?\n\nComment: I meant I don't know how to compute P(B). The question has already shown in the question above. Please read the first paragraph. P(B) means the base conditional probability which is the complement of P(B | A). So, P(B) = P(B | A)*P(A) + P(B | A)*P(A'). Therefore, can you help me compute P(B)? Thanks for pointing out that I didn't explain the question clearly.\n\nComment: When you say *the given question*, what question are you talking about?  There are several questions in the first paragraph; which one is the one to be answered?\n\nComment: Yes. What I need to compute is P(B). I updated the question. When you computed P(A | B), you didn't compute P(B) right?\n\nComment: you need to be aware that these terms, A, B are used for different things in mathematics. More precisely, they are set membership, as I explain in my answer below. What are the actual names of things being discussed in Tyler's statement of the mathematical question?\n\nAnswer: Saying that \"P(B) is 0.2\" is equivalent to interpreting \"P(good|bankrupt)\" to be the same as \"P(bankrupt)\" which is the same as \"P(bankrupt|good)\".  However, it does not appear that the expert's statement shows that they are equivalent.  The expert's statement shows that of those bonds with \"good\" ratings, 30% of them will not result in bankruptcy.  That means that 70% of them will result in bankrupt"

            " First, let's consider difference of variances between the two listed securities, shares X and shares Y. Before going further, let me explain the variance of the stock. The variance of stock is defined by two variables; the first one is daily return of the listed security, sdaily; the second one is daily return of market, smarket. As follows:\n\nvar(X) = var(daily return of X's stock) = var(sdaily + smarket) = var(sdaily)+var(smarket)+2*covar(sdaily,smarket)\n\nPlease refer the textbook 'Fundamental Financial Management' by David Finch 4th edition on page 558 for more details. It means the variance of each stock is dependent on the market because the daily return of the listed security is not only decided by the stock itself but also governed by the market. The correlation of the market is not 1 but can be anywhere between +1 and -1 for each stock. Here, it is reduced into the 2*covar(sdaily,smartket) so we have to describe each terms in the formula step by step. The smarket is computed by the change of index from each day for month, we all know smarket is between 0 and 1 for that period. Then sdaily = smonth+smarket-(smonth+smarket)2, the difference in the statement of sdaily that it is not depending on smarket. For instance, sdaily looks like below:\n\n(0.020, 0.025, -0.0712 ... #date ...).\n\nsdaily is dependent on smarket, here smarket can be less than or greater than 0 and less than or greater than 1. How to know the value of sdaily? For example, the sdaily may look like above.\n\nHence, the covariance to calculate variance of stock X for the 30 days is:\ncov(sdaily, smarket) = covariance of next day's return with that of today's return = average (covariance of daily returns for all 30 days), as follows:\ncovariance of daily returns = first daily return - smarket averaged with (sdaily average + smarket"

The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues.

Let's approach the question step by step.\n\nIf we refer to the Lambert series of Depreciation methods, the most cinematic solution in your scenario is the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System. In this depreciation method, there are three main sets: 33% salvage value, divided by three periods.\n\n1.Cars: thirdly, 90%\n\n2.Heavy trucks: 50, 33\n\n3.Cold storage equipment: 40, 30, 30\n\nThese tables help to calculate residuals between each period to compute the annual depreciation expense accurately.

So as a financial expert, you can use a terminology sentence such as \"Par value of this bond is $5,000,000\" and mention it bonds are due at January 1 of 2018 which makes 3 years. The sentence is \"five million par value due ...\".\nWhile you look up the 'bond' in dictionary, you get to know when the bonds are issued, the face value should ideally be a nominal premium and and interest will be payable on the face value or par value. So when you think about how it gets reported, you can use a phrase 'shown as face value $...' or 'par value $....'. When you think a little more you can even use a more exact phrase such as 'Also, this bond is reported as paid-in capital on the balance sheet, since the par value is more than the market value when the company originally sold the bonds to its investors.'\n\nFinally please find an answer on quora and paste the paragraph:\n\nSince the market interest rate for 3 years bond of similar risk is 3%, and ABC company is offering 2.5%, the bond is issued at a discount. The face value is $5m and the market value [of $4,392,172($5m - [$5m * (.03 -.025) / (.03)]). The face value is reported as a liability, the difference between the market value and the face value is a gain for the company and reported as a equity. The fact that the bond is issued at discount makes sense because ABC company wants to offer the bond at lower rates to appease to investors."
