            "\n\nThe general formula to calculate the price of a zero-coupon bond is:\n\nPrice = (1 + (Interest Rate \\* (Number of periods))) ^ (Number of periods)\n\nSo, for the 2-year zero-coupon bond, we can calculate its price at the end of the 1st year and the end of the 2nd year as follows:\n\nEnd of Year 1:\nPrice1\\_yr = 1 + (Interest Rate1\\_yr \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1 + (0.08 \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1.08\n\nEnd of Year 2:\nPrice2\\_yr = 1 + (Interest Rate2\\_yr \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1 + (0.08 \\* 2) ^ 1 = 1.16\n\nNow we need to take into account the duration risk. If you're not familiar with duration risk, it is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The 40 bps risk premium will be distributed over the 2 years, so it's 20 bps per year. We need to adjust the interest rates for this.\n\nAdjusted Interest Rate1\\_yr = Interest Rate1\\_yr - Duration Risk (20 bps) = 0.08 - 0.02 = 0.06\nAdjusted Interest Rate2\\_yr = Interest Rate2\\_yr - Duration Risk (20 bps) = 0.08 - 0.02 = 0.06\n\nNow let's calculate the prices of the bond at the end of the 1st year and the end of the 2nd year considering the adjusted interest rates:\n\nEnd of Year 1:\nPrice1\\_yr = 1 + (Adjusted Interest Rate1\\_yr \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1 + (0.06 \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1.06\n\nEnd of Year 2:\nPrice2\\_yr = 1 + (Adjusted Interest Rate2\\_yr \\* 1) ^ 1 = 1 + (0.06 \\* "

One year has 365 days and with a 10% interest rate, the daily interest rate would be:\n\t* (1 + 0.10) ^ (1 / 365) - 1 = 0.0027390\n3.

However, Platte River Foods has a premium of 20 basis points (0.0020) over the risk-free rate. Therefore, the risk-free rate for Platte River Foods is 0.10% + 0.0020 = 0.1020.\n2. Next, we need to calculate the roll return. We know that the initial price is 4%, and it is rolled over every six months. We will use the Futures Price connection to find the initial future price. The current price of the forward contract is $4,905.20, which represents a 3% price return (initial price). To calculate the roll return, we use the following formula: Roll Return = (price return for 6 months) \\* (6/12) + (price return for 6 months) \\* (6/12) = (0.03 \\* 0.5 + 0.03 \\* 0.5) = 0.03.\n3. Now we need to calculate the contract price and the longer term. From the table, we know that the collateral required is 20% and the position size is $1,500,000. To find the contract price, we can use the equation Contract Price = Future Price \\* Initial Price \\* (1 + risk-free rate) \\* Position Size \\* Collateral Required / Collateral Required \\* (1 + risk-free rate) - Position Size. However, we still need the initial future price to find the contract price.\n4. In order to find the initial future price, we notice that the table provides the roll return as 1.50% (instead of the expected 0.03%). This means we made an error in our calculation, and we need to recalculate the roll return using the correct initial price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.0125"

Therefore, we don't need to consider Past Service Cost.\n\nNext, we have to determine the number of years used in the denominator of the pension expense calculation. In this case, we don't have historical data on the amortization of gains and losses. However, we can estimate it using the actuarial loss. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the actuarial loss remains constant over the years.\n\nWe know that the Actuarial Loss for 2018 is 350, and the Discount Rate is 7.5%. We can use the following formula to approximate the expected amortization for the next n years:\n\nExpected Amortization = Actuarial Loss / Discount Rate = 350 / 0.075 ≈ 4,667\n\nSince we don't have the exact number of years, we will assume that the number of years is the same as the number of years in the discount rate (usually 5 or 10 years). Let's assume it's 5 years for simplicity.\n\nNow, we can calculate the average pension expense per year:\n\nPension Expense per Year = (320 + Amortization of Gains and Losses) / 5\n\nPlugging in the approximation for the amortization:\n\nPension Expense per Year ≈ (320 + 4,667) / 5 ≈ 961\n\nTherefore, the average recurrent pension expense that would be presented in the income statement as per US GAAP for XYZ NY is approximately $961 per year."

Subtract the likelihood of no defective vehicles from 1 to find the likelihood that exactly one vehicle is defective.\n\nAnswer: First, let's calculate the mean and standard deviation of the Poisson distribution. The mean is equal to the rate, i.e., λ = 5% defective vehicles per 1,000 vehicles. So, λ = 0.05 \\* 1,000 = 50 defective vehicles per 1,000 vehicles. To find the standard deviation (σ), we need to use the following formula for the Poisson distribution: σ = √(λ). Thus, σ = √(50) ≈ 7.07.\n\nNow, let's use the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) to find the likelihood that no vehicles are defective. For a Poisson distribution, the CCDF is given by:\n\nP(X >= 0) = 1 - e^(-λ)\n\nPutting in the values, we get:\n\nP(X >= 0) = 1 - e^(-50) ≈ 1 - 0.9975 ≈ 0.0025\n\nNow, we need to calculate the likelihood that at least one vehicle is defective. For this, we can find the probability that exactly one vehicle is defective and add the probabilities of more than one vehicle being defective. The probability of exactly one vehicle being defective is given by:\n\nP(1 defective) = e^(-50) / 50 ≈ 0.013\n\nThe probability of two or more vehicles being defective can be calculated using the binomial distribution.

Next, we need to find the population standard deviation, which we don't know. But we are given the standard deviation of the observed samples, so we can assume that the population standard deviation is also 100.\n3. Therefore, the answer is: Since the population standard deviation is defined as the root mean square of the population, and it is given as 100, the standard error of the sample mean is sqrt(100 \\* (1/1000 - 1/1600)) = sqrt(9.09) ≈ 3.03."

            "\n\n1. First, let's decide how many days we should consider for calculating the Value at Risk (VAR). We normally use 1% as an estimate for the daily volatility in VAR calculations. With a 95% confidence level, we would usually consider a 1-day VAR (1 standard deviation) and a 5-day VAR (2 standard deviations).\n2. Now we need to calculate the total modified duration of the portfolio, which is the sum of the modified durations of the individual bonds. In this case, the initial bond has a modified duration of 1 year and the second bond has a modified duration of 9 years. The total modified duration is (1 + 9) years = 10 years.\n3. Next, we'll find the change in the price of the portfolio for a 1% change in the yield. This can be calculated as (Total Modified Duration) \\* (Percentage Change in Yield) = (10 years) \\* (0.01) = 0.10 or 10% change in the price of the portfolio.\n4. To calculate the VAR, we first need to convert the 95% confidence level to a Z-score. Using the standard normal distribution, the Z-score for a 95% confidence level is 1.645.\n5. Now, we calculate the standard deviation (SD) of the daily price changes, which is the square root of the annualized volatility (or the annualized standard deviation of returns) multiplied by the square root of the Total Modified Duration.\n6. Finally, we can calculate the daily VAR at the 95% confidence level as SD \\* Z-score, which is (SD) \\* (1.645) = 0.10 \\* 1.645 ≈ 1.65 or 165% change in the price of the portfolio.\n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes the yields change linearly with the yield curve and all changes in yield lead to equal shifts in the price of the bonds. Otherwise, a more complex calculation would be needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.165 or 165% change in the price of the portfolio."

Next, we need to determine the contract rate, which is 2.5% because the bonds yield an annual rate of 2.5% on 31 December.\n3. We should find the number of periods and the periodic interest rate for the three-year bonds. Since a three-year bond has 36 periods (3 years x 12 months), the periodic interest rate will be (1 + 2.5%)^(1/36)-1 ≈ 0.007058 or 0.7058%.\n4. With the par value, contract rate, and periodic interest rate, now we can use the effective interest method to calculate the carrying amount of the bonds at the time of issuance. The carrying amount of the bonds would be $5,000,000 + (5,000,000 \\* 0.025) / [(1 + 0.007058)^36 - 1] = $5,000,780.\n\nSo, how are the bonds payable reported when issued? They are most likely reported as bonds payable for $5,007,800.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $5,007,800."
