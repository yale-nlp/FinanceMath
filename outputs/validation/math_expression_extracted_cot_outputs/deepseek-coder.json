A PED of 1.8 indicates that a 1% increase in price will lead to a 1.8% decrease in quantity demanded.\n\n2. **Marginal Cost and Average Cost**: Marginal cost (MC) is the increase in total cost that arises from producing one additional unit of a good. Average cost (AC) is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.\n\n3. **Optimal Pricing Strategy**: For a firm to maximize profit, it should set its price based on the relationship between price elasticity of demand and marginal cost. The optimal price (P) can be determined using the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{MC}{1 - \\frac{1}{|PED|}}\n   \\]\n   This formula accounts for the fact that a higher elasticity of demand means consumers are more sensitive to price changes, requiring the firm to set a lower price.\n\n4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula**:\n   - Marginal Cost (MC) = $30\n   - Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) = 1.8\n\n   Using the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{30}{1 - \\frac{1}{1.8}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Formula**:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{30}{1 - \\frac{1}{1.8}} = \\frac{30}{1 - 0.5556} = \\frac{30}{0.4444} = 67.5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the most probable price is $67.5."

This represents the capital expenditures for the year.\n\n5. **Change in Net Working Capital (NWC):**\n   - To find the change in NWC, we need to calculate the difference in Total Current Assets and Current Liabilities between 2012 and 2011.\n   - Total Current Assets in 2012: $1,290 million\n   - Total Current Assets in 2011: $1,199 million\n   - Change in Total Current Assets: $1,290 - $1,199 = $91 million\n   - Current Liabilities in 2012: $2,783 million\n   - Current Liabilities in 2011: $2,678 million\n   - Change in Current Liabilities: $2,783 - $2,678 = $105 million\n   - Change in NWC: Change in Current Assets - Change in Current Liabilities = $91 - $105 = -$14 million\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the FCFF formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{FCFF} = \\text{EBIT} \\times (1 - \\text{Tax Rate}) + \\text{Depreciation} - \\text{Capital Expenditures} - \\text{Change in Net Working Capital} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{FCFF} = 1106 \\times (1 - 0.32) + 243 - 535 - (-14) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{FCFF} = 1106 \\times 0.68 + 243 - 535 + 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{FCFF} = 752.08 + 243 - 535 + 14 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{FCFF} = 474.08 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is $474.08 million."

            "To determine the five-year spot rate, we need to use the information provided in the table and the relationship between par rates and spot rates. The par rate is the yield to maturity of a bond priced at par, and the spot rate is the yield for a zero-coupon bond of the same maturity.\n\nGiven the par rates and spot rates for the first four years, we can use the bootstrapping method to find the five-year spot rate. The bootstrapping method involves using the known spot rates to find the unknown spot rate.\n\nHere are the steps to find the five-year spot rate:\n\n1. **Identify the given par rates and spot rates:**\n   - One-Year: Par Rate = 2.50%, Spot Rate = 2.50%\n   - Two-Year: Par Rate = 2.99%, Spot Rate = 3.00%\n   - Three-Year: Par Rate = 3.48%, Spot Rate = 3.50%\n   - Four-Year: Par Rate = 3.95%, Spot Rate = 4.00%\n   - Five-Year: Par Rate = 4.37%, Spot Rate = ?\n\n2. **Set up the equation for the five-year par rate:**\n   The par rate for a bond is the average of the spot rates for each period, discounted by the spot rates. For a five-year bond, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Par Rate}_{5} = \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{1})^1} + \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{2})^2} + \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{3})^3} + \\frac{C}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{4})^4} + \\frac{C + 100}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is the annual coupon payment.\n\n3. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**\n   Since the bond is priced at par, the coupon rate is equal to the par rate. Therefore, \\( C = 4.37 \\) for each year.\n\n4. **Solve for the five-year spot rate:**\n   \\[\n   4.37 = \\frac{4.37}{(1 + 0.025)^1} + \\frac{4.37}{(1 + 0.030)^2} + \\frac{4.37}{(1 + 0.035)^3} + \\frac{4.37}{(1 + 0.040)^4} + \\frac{4.37 + 100}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   4.37 = \\frac{4.37}{1.025} + \\frac{4.37}{1.030^2} + \\frac{4.37}{1.035^3} + \\frac{4.37}{1.040^4} + \\frac{104.37}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the present value of each cash flow:**\n   \\[\n   4.37 = 4.263 + 4.157 + 4.053 + 3.951 + \\frac{104.37}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Isolate the unknown spot rate term:**\n   \\[\n   4.37 - (4.263 + 4.157 + 4.053 + 3.951) = \\frac{104.37}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4.37 - 16.424 = \\frac{104.37}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -12.054 = \\frac{104.37}{(1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solve for the spot rate:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + \\text{Spot Rate}_{5})^5 = \\frac{104.37}{-12.054}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (1"

Delta represents the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n\n2. **Identify the Given Values**:\n   - Current share price (S) = USD 26.00\n   - Daily volatility (σ) = 1.5% = 0.015\n   - Delta (Δ) of the put option = -0.5\n   - Confidence level for VaR = 95%\n\n3. **Determine the Z-score for 95% Confidence**:\n   - For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score (Z) is approximately 1.645.\n\n4. **Calculate the Daily Standard Deviation of the Underlying Asset**:\n   - The daily standard deviation (σ_daily) is given by the volatility:\n     \\[\n     σ_daily = 0.015 \\times 26.00 = 0.39 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the VaR of the Underlying Asset**:\n   - VaR of the underlying asset for 1 day at 95% confidence:\n     \\[\n     \\text{VaR}_{underlying} = Z \\times σ_daily = 1.645 \\times 0.39 = 0.64155 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the VaR of the Option Position Using the Delta**:\n   - Since the delta of the put option is -0.5, the VaR of the option position is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{VaR}_{option} = Δ \\times \\text{VaR}_{underlying} = -0.5 \\times 0.64155 = -0.320775 \\text{ USD}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Interpret the Result**:\n   - The negative sign indicates that the put option will gain value if the stock price decreases.

Therefore, we take the reciprocal of 0.65 to find the leverage ratio:\n  1 / 0.65 = 1.5385\n\nStep 5: Round the leverage ratio to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n- Typically, leverage ratios are expressed to two decimal places.

            "1. **Understand the Concept of Price Elasticity of Demand**: Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price.

The profit-maximizing price can be determined using the relationship between price, marginal cost (MC), and the price elasticity of demand (PED). The formula for the profit-maximizing price \\( P \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\text{MC}}{1 - \\frac{1}{|\\text{PED}|}}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( |\\text{PED}| \\) denotes the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand.\n\n3. **Substitute the Given Values**:\n   - Marginal Cost (MC) = $40\n   - Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) = 1.5\n\n   Using the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{1}{1.5}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Formula**:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{1}{1.5}} = \\frac{40}{1 - \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{40}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 40 \\times 3 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is $120."

It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     DOL = \\frac{\\text{Percentage change in Operating Income}}{\\text{Percentage change in Sales}}\n     \\]\n   - Alternatively, it can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     DOL = \\frac{\\text{Contribution Margin}}{\\text{Operating Income}}\n     \\]\n   - Contribution Margin (CM) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{CM} = \\text{Unit Contribution Margin} \\times \\text{Units Sold}\n     \\]\n   - Operating Income (OI) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{OI} = \\text{CM} - \\text{Fixed Costs}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Given Data**:\n   - Unit Contribution Margin (UCM) = $20\n   - Fixed Costs (FC) = $500,000\n\n3. **Calculating DOL at Different Production Levels**:\n   - To find the production level where DOL is the least, we need to calculate DOL at various production levels and observe the trend.\n\n4. **Example Calculation at a Specific Production Level**:\n   - Let's consider a production level of 30,000 units.\n     - Contribution Margin (CM) = $20 \\times 30,000 = $600,000\n     - Operating Income (OI) = $600,000 - $500,000 = $100,000\n     - DOL = $\\frac{600,000}{100,000} = 6$\n\n5. **Generalizing the Calculation**:\n   - For any production level \\( Q \\):\n     - CM = $20 \\times Q\n     - OI = $20 \\times Q - $500,000\n     - DOL = $\\frac{20Q}{20Q - 500,000}$\n\n6. **Analyzing the DOL Formula**:\n   - As \\( Q \\) increases, the term \\( 20Q \\) in the numerator and denominator both increase, but the denominator \\( 20Q - 500,000 \\) increases faster.\n   - Therefore, DOL decreases as \\( Q \\) increases.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The DOL is least at the highest production level within the given range. Since the fixed costs are specified up to 300,000 units, the highest production level within this range is 300,000 units.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 300,000."

Typically, valuation methods for REITs include price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, price-to-funds from operations (P/FFO), and price-to-adjusted funds from operations (P/AFFO). Given the data provided, it is likely that Method 4 involves using the P/AFFO multiple.\n\n2. **Calculate the Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) for REIT B**:\n   - AFFO is typically calculated as FFO minus recurring capital expenditures.\n   - From the table, we have:\n     - FFO for REIT B = $290,612\n     - Recurring maintenance-type capital expenditures for REIT B = $60,852\n   - Therefore, AFFO for REIT B = $290,612 - $60,852 = $229,760\n\n3. **Determine the P/AFFO multiple for REIT B**:\n   - The table provides the property subsector average P/AFFO multiple for REIT B as 17.1x.\n\n4. **Calculate the total market value using the P/AFFO multiple**:\n   - Total market value = AFFO × P/AFFO multiple\n   - Total market value = $229,760 × 17.1 = $3,929,896\n\n5. **Determine the share value**:\n   - Shares outstanding for REIT B = 67,900\n   - Share value = Total market value / Shares outstanding\n   - Share value = $3,929,896 / 67,900 = $57.88\n\nTherefore, the answer is $57.88."

        "question": "A financial expert predicts that 20% of high-risk bonds will go bankrupt. When he uses a bankruptcy prediction model, he finds that 70% of these bonds will be deemed as \"good\", suggesting a lower risk of failure. Of the bonds that went bankrupt, only 50% were rated as \"good\". Use Bayes' formula to estimate the likelihood of going bankrupt bearing a \"good\" rating. (Hint, let P(A) be the likelihood of bankruptcy, P(B) be the probability of a \"good\" rating, P(B | A) be the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy, and P(A | B) be the likelihood of bankruptcy given a \"good\" rating.)",

            "To solve the problem using Bayes' formula, we need to define the probabilities and apply the formula step by step.\n\n1. **Define the probabilities:**\n   - \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of bankruptcy, which is given as 20%, or 0.20.\n   - \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of a \"good\" rating. We need to calculate this from the given information.\n   - \\( P(B | A) \\) is the probability of a \"good\" rating given bankruptcy, which is given as 50%, or 0.50.\n   - \\( P(A | B) \\) is the probability of bankruptcy given a \"good\" rating, which we need to find.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( P(B) \\):**\n   - We know that 70% of the bonds are deemed as \"good\", suggesting a lower risk of failure. Therefore, \\( P(B) = 0.70 \\).\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' formula:**\n   \\[\n   P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the known values into Bayes' formula:**\n   \\[\n   P(A | B) = \\frac{0.50 \\cdot 0.20}{0.70}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the calculation:**\n   \\[\n   P(A | B) = \\frac{0.10}{0.70} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.1429\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of going bankrupt bearing a \"good\" rating is approximately 0.1429 or 14.29%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.1429."

These components include the service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the gain or loss from the changes in the PBO and plan assets. Here’s how we can break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Service Cost**: This is the cost attributed to the benefits earned by employees during the period. Since it is not explicitly provided, we will assume it is included in the change in PBO.\n\n2. **Interest Cost**: This is the increase in the PBO due to the passage of time, calculated as the PBO at the beginning of the year multiplied by the discount rate. We don't have the discount rate, so we'll use the change in PBO to infer this cost.\n\n3. **Expected Return on Plan Assets**: This is the expected return on the plan assets, which is typically calculated as the beginning value of plan assets multiplied by the expected rate of return. We don't have the expected rate of return, so we'll use the actual change in the value of plan assets.\n\n4. **Gain or Loss**: This is the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return, and also the change in PBO not explained by the interest cost.\n\nGiven the data:\n- PBO at the start of the year: $45,000\n- PBO at the end of the year: $43,500\n- Plan assets at the start of the year: $40,800\n- Plan assets at the end of the year: $39,650\n- Company contributions: $1,200\n\nFirst, let's calculate the change in PBO and plan assets:\n- Change in PBO = PBO end of year - PBO start of year = $43,500 - $45,000 = -$1,500\n- Change in plan assets = Plan assets end of year - Plan assets start of year = $39,650 - $40,800 = -$1,150\n\nNext, let's calculate the interest cost and expected return on plan assets:\n- Interest Cost (assumed to be the change in PBO) = -$1,500\n- Expected Return on Plan Assets (assumed to be the change in plan assets) = -$1,150\n\nNow, let's calculate the gain or loss:\n- Gain or Loss = Change in PBO - Interest Cost = -$1,500 - (-$1,500) = $0\n\nFinally, let's sum up the components to find the overall recurring pension cost:\n- Overall Recurring Pension Cost = Service Cost + Interest Cost + Expected Return on Plan Assets + Gain or Loss + Company Contributions\n- Assuming Service Cost is included in the change in PBO, we have:\n  Overall Recurring Pension Cost = -$1,500 + -$1,150 + $0 + $1,200 = -$1,450\n\nTherefore, the answer is -$1,450."
