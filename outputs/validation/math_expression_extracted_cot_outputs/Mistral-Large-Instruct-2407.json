        "output": [
            " To determine the most probable price for Yahoo Corp., we need to consider the price elasticity of demand and the company's costs. Here is a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the price elasticity of demand**:\n   - The price elasticity of demand (PED) is given as 1.8. This means that the demand for the product is elastic, indicating that any increase in price would lead to a more than proportional decrease in quantity demanded.\n\n2. **Marginal cost (MC)**:\n   - The marginal cost is $30. This is the cost of producing one more unit of the product.\n\n3. **Average cost (AC)**:\n   - The average cost is $50. This is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.\n\n4. **Revenue maximization and PED**:\n   - Since the PED is greater than 1 (1.8), the firm operates in the elastic portion of the demand curve. In an elastic demand scenario, increasing the price will lead to a decrease in total revenue. Therefore, to maximize revenue, the firm should set the price where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC).\n\n5. **Relation between price and marginal revenue**:\n   - The relationship between price (P) and marginal revenue (MR) for a monopolist can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{PED}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Given that PED = 1.8, we can substitute this into the equation:\n     \\[\n     MR = P \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1.8}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the equation:\n     \\[\n     MR = P \\left(1 + 0.5556\\right) = P \\times 1.5556\n     \\]\n\n6. **Setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost**:\n   - We know that MR = MC for revenue maximization. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     30 = P \\times 1.5556\n     \\]\n   - Solving for P:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{30}{1.5556} \\approx 1"

            " To determine the maximum leverage ratio linked with a position financed by a 65% minimum margin requirement, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Margin Requirement**: A margin requirement is the percentage of the total position value that an investor must pay with their own funds. The rest can be borrowed from the brokerage.\n\n2. **Calculate the Minimum Margin**: If the margin requirement is 65%, it means that for every $100 of the total position value, the investor must put down $65.\n\n3. **Determine the Borrowed Amount**: The remaining part of the position can be borrowed. If the investor must put down $65, the broker will lend $35 (100 - 65 = 35).\n\n4. **Calculate Leverage Ratio**: Leverage is the ratio of the total position value to the amount the investor must put up. It is typically expressed as a multiple of the margin requirement.\n\nLet's calculate the leverage ratio step by step:\n\n- Margin requirement = 65%\n- Amount invested by the investor = 65% of the total position value\n- Amount borrowed from the broker = 100% - 65% = 35% of the total position value\n\nLeverage ratio = Total position value / Investor's invested amount\nLeverage ratio = 100% / 65%\nLeverage ratio = 1 / 0.65\nLeverage ratio ≈ 1.5385\n\nTherefore, the maximum leverage ratio is approximately 1.5385.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.5385."

            " 1. **Calculate the total return from the investment:**\n   The investment yielded a return of 15.5%. Therefore, the total return from the investment is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total return} = 10,000 \\text{ stocks} \\times 15.5\\% = 10,000 \\times 0.155 = 1,550\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total amount received from selling the stocks:**\n   The investor sold the stocks at $24 each. Therefore, the total amount received from selling the stocks is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total from selling} = 10,000 \\text{ stocks} \\times \\$24 = 240,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add the dividend received:**\n   The investor also received a dividend of $2,500. Adding this to the total amount received from selling the stocks gives:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total received} = 240,000 + 2,500 = 242,500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total amount invested:**\n   The total amount received (242,500) includes the initial investment plus the 15.5% return. Therefore, the initial investment can be calculated by subtracting the return from the total amount received:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total investment} = \\text{Total received} - \\text{Total return} = 242,500 - 1,550 = 240,950\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cost per stock:**\n   The investor initially bought 10,000 stocks. Therefore, the cost per stock is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per stock} = \\frac{\\text{Total investment}}{10,000 \\text{ stocks}} = \\frac{240,950}{10,000} = 24.095\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is $24.095."

Therefore, the initial cost is $3 million.\n\n2. **Calculate the amortization expense**: Since the software copyright is to be held for 20 years, we need to calculate the annual amortization expense. The formula for annual amortization is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual Amortization} = \\frac{\\text{Cost} - \\text{Salvage Value}}{\\text{Useful Life}}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Annual Amortization} = \\frac{3,000,000 - 10,000}{20} = \\frac{2,990,000}{20} = 149,500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total amortization expense for 2014**: Since 2014 is the first year, only one year of amortization will be recorded. Thus, the total amortization expense for 2014 is $149,500.\n\n4. **Calculate the book value at the end of 2014**: The book value at the end of 2014 is the initial cost minus the accumulated amortization for the year.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Book Value at end of 2014} = \\text{Initial Cost} - \\text{Amortization Expense}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Book Value at end of 2014} = 3,000,000 - 149,500 = 2,850,500\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is $2,850,500."

            " To determine the production level at which the Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) is the least, we need to understand the concept of DOL and how it is influenced by the factors given.\n\n**Step 1: Understand DOL**\nThe Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) is a measure of how sensitive operating income is to changes in sales. It is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{DOL} = \\frac{Q \\times (P - V)}{Q \\times (P - V) - F} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the quantity sold,\n- \\( P \\) is the price per unit,\n- \\( V \\) is the variable cost per unit,\n- \\( F \\) is the fixed costs.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the DOL formula**\nGiven \\( P - V \\) is the contribution margin per unit, let's denote it as \\( CM \\). The DOL formula then simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{DOL} = \\frac{Q \\times CM}{Q \\times CM - F} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Understand the key values**\n- Contribution margin per unit (\\( CM \\)) is given as $20.\n- Fixed costs (\\( F \\)) are given as $500,000.\n\n**Step 4: Express DOL in terms of Q**\n\\[ \\text{DOL} = \\frac{20Q}{20Q - 500,000} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Behavior of DOL**\nThe denominator \\( 20Q - 500,000 \\) will increase as \\( Q \\) increases. As \\( Q \\) approaches a very large number, the DOL will approach 1 because the term \\( 20Q \\) dominates the fixed costs \\( 500,000 \\). Therefore, DOL will be the smallest when \\( Q \\) is very large because the fixed costs term \\( 500,000 \\) will have a diminishing effect.\n\nThus, the Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) will theoretically be the least at very high production levels.

Firm A capitalizes the printer and it undergoes straight-line depreciation, while Firm B expenses the printer. The following year-end data is collected for Firm A. Based on this information, what would Firm B’s return on equity be using year-end equity with the ending shareholders’ equity being £10,000,000, a tax rate of 25%, £0.00 in dividends, and a net income of £750,000?",

This means the spread has decreased by 100 basis points, or 1%.\n\n### Step 2: Effect of Duration on Bond Price\nDuration measures the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in interest rates (or spreads).

The formula to calculate the price change due to convexity (C) is:\n\\[ \\Delta P_{\\text{convexity}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times C \\times (\\Delta Y)^2 \\times P \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Convexity (C) = 55.0\n- Change in yield"
