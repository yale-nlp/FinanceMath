This means that a small change in price will lead to a significant change in quantity demanded.\n\n**Step 5: Use the price elasticity of demand to determine the most probable price.**\n\nSince the price elasticity of demand is negative, a price increase will cause a decrease in demand.\n\nTherefore, the most probable price would be the lowest price at which demand is still inelastic.

Since the position is held for a long term, the roll return is equal to the price return. Therefore, the roll return for the hedge position is 4%.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the risk contribution (Collateral required).**\n\nThe risk contribution is the percentage of capital that a trader needs to provide to secure a position. In this case, the risk contribution is 20%.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the contract price.**\n\nThe contract price is the price per unit of the underlying asset that is derived from the initial position size. Therefore, the contract price is equal to the initial position size divided by the current price, which is $1,500,000 / $4 = $375,000.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the current position size.**\n\nThe current position size is the size of the position that the trader has open at the current moment, which is $500.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the overall return.**\n\nThe overall return is the weighted sum of the roll return and the risk contribution. Therefore, the overall return is (4% x $750,000) + (20% x $500) = 30 + $10 = 40.\n\nTherefore, the overall return for the hedge position of Platte River Foods is 40%. Therefore, the answer is 40."

Therefore, they may find significantly different P/E ratios even though the company's business outlook remains the same. Brian suggested using normalized EPS to solve this issue. Having gathered information about the company throughout the most recent complete cycle, the 2 junior analysts found that the company's balance sheet reveals total assets worth 2100 million and total liabilities of 1200 million.

            "**Step 1: Determine the issue price of the bonds**\n\nThe issue price of a bond is the price at which the bonds are issued to investors in exchange for their money. It is calculated by dividing the total amount of bonds issued by the number of bonds issued.\n\nIn this case, the total amount of bonds issued is 3,000,000 and the number of bonds issued is 2,000,000. Therefore, the issue price of the bonds would be:\n\nIssue price = Total amount of bonds issued / Number of bonds issued = $5,000,000 / 2,000,000 = $2.50 per bond\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the bond coupon payment**\n\nThe annual coupon payment is the interest that investors will receive from the bond issuer in exchange for their investment. It is calculated as a fixed amount, which is equal to the issue price multiplied by the annual interest rate.\n\nIn this case, the annual coupon payment would be:\n\nAnnual coupon payment = Issue price * Annual interest rate = $2.50 per bond * 0.025 = $0.0625 per bond per year\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maturity value of the bonds**\n\nThe maturity value of a bond is the amount of money that investors will receive back when the bonds mature. It is calculated by adding the face value of the bond to the annual coupon payments over the bond's life.\n\nTo calculate the maturity value, we would use the following formula:\n\nMaturity value = Face value + Annual coupon payments × (Number of years to maturity)\n\nIn this case, the maturity value of the bonds would be:\n\nMaturity value = $5,000,000 + $0.0625 per bond per year × 3 = $5,312,500\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the annual interest payment and interest payment as a percentage of the face value**\n\nThe annual interest payment is the interest paid by investors in a year, which is equal to the coupon payment. The annual interest payment would be:\n\nAnnual interest payment = Annual coupon payment = $0.0625 per bond per year\n\nThe annual interest payment as a percentage of the face value would be:\n\nAnnual interest payment as % of face value = 0.0625/ $5,0"
