The surplus of the acquisition cost over the net assets' fair value of Snowflake was due to previously unregistered licenses. These licenses were estimated to possess an economic lifespan of five years. The value of Snowflake's assets and liabilities, excluding licenses, were equivalent to their documented book value. Clearwater and Snowflake's summarized income statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, and Balance Sheet are presented in the subsequent table: Assuming that both companies' 2019 figures mirror those of 2018 and Clearwater has command over Snowflake, what would be Clearwater’s consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for 2019?",

The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues. Based off the definition of RAROC, what would Johnson's prediction about RAROC be?",
