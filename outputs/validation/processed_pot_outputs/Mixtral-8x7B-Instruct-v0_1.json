Johnson and his colleagues predict that, due to a recent reorganization, the firm probably won't distribute dividends for the following three years. However, they anticipate that ABC will start paying an annual dividend of US$1.72 for each share starting from the fourth year onwards. After this, the dividend is predicted to experience a perpetual growth of 4%, though the present price suggests a growth rate of 6% for the identical timeframe. If Johnson's team employs the dividend discount model, what would be the current inherent value of Company ABC stock?",

These licenses were estimated to possess an economic lifespan of five years. The value of Snowflake's assets and liabilities, excluding licenses, were equivalent to their documented book value.

        "question": "Analyst Johnson is determining the RAROC of a commercial loan portfolio for Company P. He has gathered the following details: The primary borrowing is $1.3 billion. The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues. Based off the definition of RAROC, what would Johnson's prediction about RAROC be?",

We can also use built-in Python function for this calculation: `math.factorial()`. The Poisson distribution applies when:\n\n- Events happen at a constant rate per unit of time or space\n- We can't predict when a given event will happen, only that we expect some number of events to happen\n\nThe average rate, multiplied by the constant 1, is the parameter of the Poisson distribution. In our problem, the average rate is `prob_defective`, i.e., (5% / 100%).\n\nThe `np.math.factorial()` function calculates a factorial of an integer `i`, defined as `i != 0 -> 1`, `1 != 0 -> 1`, `2 != 0 -> 2`, `...`, `9 != 0 -> 9`, `10 != 0 -> 10 * 9 * ... 2 * 1 = 10!`.\n\nAlso, at each time interval, there's one customer attached to one and only one random event. These events are independent of each other, meaning that the probability of having a given number of events doesn't depend on the other events. Taking into account all this information, the probabilities of having 0, 1, 2, ..., `n` customers at the same time are given by the elements of a Poisson PMF."

The number of ways to distribute $100 to n people is equal to n factorial divided by the factorial of (n - 1). This is because you choose 1 person out of n to receive $100. The number of ways to distribute the remaining prize of $50 is equal to the total number of remaining people minus 1 factorial divided by the factorial of all participants minus the number of people who receive $100 minus the number of people who receive $50 (because you choose 2 people out of n - 1 to receive $50). The number of ways to distribute the remaining prize of $10 is equal to the total number of remaining people minus 1 minus the number of people who receive $50 minus the number of people who receive $10 factorial divided by the factorial of all participants minus the number of people who receive $50 minus the number of people who receive $10 minus the number of people who receive $100 (because you choose 3 people out of n - 1 - 2 to receive $10). The result is the product of these three values. To generalize, the answer is n factorial divided by the product of factorials of n minus prizes."
