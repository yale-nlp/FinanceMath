He would like for the loan to be collateralized by the EUR he already has, without actually using an existing equity. He could use either a non-synthetic or a synthetic repo. Please answer the following questions:\n\nGiven:\n- Spot EUR/USD = 1.4100 and 3M USD Libor = 1.225%\n\n(1) Ignore collateral selection and opt for a fully-collateralized non-synthetic repo. What would be the all-in cost in EUR per annum? Bob's currently dealing in an inter-bank market but is shopping around. He wants three bids.\n\n(2) How would the quote and the profitability change if he selected a synthetic repo with a strip of US Libor swaps? Assume that the market swap curve is flat for all maturities, so all swap spreads are 0 bps. Now compare this cost with your previously computed cost.\n```python\nfunciton solution():\n    # define variables name and value\n\n<< based on your own definition >>\n\n    # do math calculation to get the answer\n\n<< based on your own calculation >>\n\n    # return answer\n\n<< based on your own criteria >>\n```\n\nAnswer:\nMany of questions asked in the interviews require you to come up with a clever algorithms or re-using well-known algorithms to solve the question. For example, this question has two parts: (1) you should remember how to calculate Annualized cost (cutten pt APR) and if you don't know how to do this calculation, you could give up interview easily; (2) second part of the question requires you to use optimization software /model to give the most cost effective result. This is a skill can be mastered by practice and practice, plus there are many reasons why can fail to do optimization: the model might be wrong; the math might be wrong; the configuration has a problem.\n\nAlways keep these questions in mind during the entire interview:\n    What are the Requirements and/or Lenguage used for a problem"

These licenses were estimated to possess an economic lifespan of five years. The value of Snowflake's assets and liabilities, excluding licenses, were equivalent to their documented book value. Clearwater and Snowflake's summarized income statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, and Balance Sheet are presented in the subsequent table: Assuming that both companies' 2019 figures mirror those of 2018 and Clearwater has command over Snowflake, what would be Clearwater’s consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for 2019?",

Here is shown how to return an answer in a string format:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    return 200\n```\n\nThe returned value will be a string in the following format:\n\n```\nSolution.SolutionClass.method.solution\n```\n\nwhere: `SolutionClass` is the name of the class, usually starts with an uppercase letter, `method` is the name of the method in your Python program (lowercase letters only), `solution` is the returned answer.\n\nLet's take print () as an example. In the Python program, the print () should be used when you want to return a string as the answer. The returned string contains some whitespaces and \"\\n\" at the end of the string.\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    revenue = str(600000) + ' '\n    avg_account_receivable = str(50000) + ' '\n    receivables_turnover = str(revenue) + ' ' + '/' + ' ' + str(avg_account_receivable)\n    answer = str(365) + ' ' + '/' + ' ' + str(receivables_turnover)\n    \n    #return answer\n    print('Solution', revenue, avg_account_receivable, receivables_turnover, answer)\n    \n\n```\nThe first 4 lines are defined to calculate the variables.\nNote that we should add a special character \" \" to the end of strings so that we can print variable names and corresponding strings together.\n```Note:\nYou need to import the Python language library as we do in compiling the Python code:\n```python\nimport your.custom.library.path\n```\n\nPart 3\nYou want to return an answer as a boolean value using is_answer methods. If you answer this question, Python judges you can"

The alt key, when pressed with another key, adds the unfamiliar letters including the British £ sign. On Mac, it takes certain left and right mode combinations of the Alt (or Option) key and the letter “P” to produce the British £ symbol, whereas on PC you can simply use left-alt + P in most cases (depending on the font being used if there are non-English options installed). Check your system to see if alt + P, n, or m doesn’t produce the £ sterling pound symbol! Note: one of these may be the correct answer."

The predicted pre-tax profit from the loan portfolio is 7%. The estimated direct annual operation cost is around $6 million. The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues.

Define the constructor method of the class (named __init__) to receive one requried parameter:name(type String) and one optional parameter:id(type integer,default == None).\nThis constructor must calculate the employee's age automatically. To do so, create another method named calculateAge and ask for two date values, namely DOB and the curre date(NOW),as parameters. This method should return Employee's age in years.
