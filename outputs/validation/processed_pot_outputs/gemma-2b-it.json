The `calculate_return` function takes two arguments: the year and the return for that year.\n\nThe program then iterates through the `annual_rates` list and calculates the holding period return for the three-year timeframe by summing the returns for all the years in the list. Finally, it returns the holding period return, which is the average of all the returns in the list."

The `solution()` function takes no arguments.\n\n2. We define two variables, `present_value` and `discount_rate`.\n\n3. `present_value` represents the initial amount of $5,000.\n\n4. `discount_rate` represents the monthly discount rate of 5%.\n\n5. We calculate the monthly discount using the formula `discount_rate / 12`. This means that the discount is applied to the monthly payment amount.\n\n6. The present value is calculated using the formula: `present_value_pv = present_value / (1 - discount_rate) ^ 36`. This formula considers the present value of the future payments, where the discount is applied after each compounding period.\n\n7. The function returns the calculated present value."

The first function defines the `solution` function.\n2. The function takes no arguments and returns a float value representing the concentration ratio.\n3. It defines a list called `market_share` with the sales of different companies in millions.\n4. It calculates the concentration ratio using the formula `4 / market_share.sum()`. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total sales.\n5. The function returns the concentration ratio as a float value.\n\n**Output:**\n```python\n0.2\n```\n\nThis indicates that the concentration ratio of the four firms is 0.2, meaning that Ajiwo, Bdfhyj, Cegfd, and Ddgh have a significant market share in the industry."
