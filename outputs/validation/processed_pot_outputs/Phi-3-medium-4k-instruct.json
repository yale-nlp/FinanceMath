Define the par value, coupon rate, required rate of return, and the number of periods. Since payments are semiannual, the periods will be twice the number of years, and the required rate of return must be adjusted to a semiannual basis as well.\n\n2. Calculate the semiannual coupon payment by multiplying the par value by the annual coupon rate and then dividing by 2.\n\n3. Calculate the present value of the coupon payments by discounting each payment back to the present using the semiannual required rate of return.\n\n4. Calculate the present value of the par value to be received at the end of the maturity by discounting it back using the semiannual required rate of return.\n\n5. Sum the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the par value to get the bond's price.\n\nHere's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    par_value = 100              # The par value of the bond\n    annual_coupon_rate = 0.03    # The annual coupon rate (3% as a decimal)\n    semiannual_coupon_rate = annual_coupon_rate / 2  # Convert annual rate to semiannual\n    required_rate_of_return = 0.05  # The required rate of return (5% as a decimal)\n    semiannual_required_rate_of_return = required_rate_of_return / 2  # Convert annual rate to semiannual\n    maturity_years = 3             # The maturity time in years\n    number_of"

            " To calculate the five-year spot rate based on the given spot rates for shorter maturities, we can use bootstrapping method. The idea here is to solve for the unknown five-year spot rate that equates the present value of a 5-year zero-coupon bond (which pays $100 at maturity and has a face value of $100) to its current market price.\n\nThe formula to calculate the price of an annual-coupon bond is as follows:\n\nPrice = C / (1 + s_1) + C / (1 + s_2)^2 + ... + C / (1 + s_n)^n + M / (1 + s_n)^n\n\nwhere,\nC = annual coupon payment\nM = face value (also known as the maturity value)\ns_n = spot rate for nth year\n\nGiven the lack of spot rates or coupon payments for the five-year bond, we have to solve for it using the previous known rates. The yield to maturity may not be the same as the yield to call, but the information provided does not indicate any call provisions.\n\nSo, our objective is to find s_5 such that the price of an annual-coupon bond with par amount $100, having a par rate of 4.37%, and a spot rate sequence for the first four years (2.50%, 3.00%, 3.50%, 4.00%) equals its market price (which in this case we can assume to be $100).\n\nLet's implement this in a Python program:\n\n```python\ndef solution() -> float:\n    par_value = 100\n\n    # Known spot rates\n    spot_rates = [0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04]\n\n    # Par rate for the five year bond\n    par_rate_5 = 0.0437\n\n    # Calculate coupon payment (annual)\n    coupon_payment = par_value * par_rate_5\n\n    # Initialize cumulative present value\n    cumulative_pv = 0.0\n\n    # Eurodiscount rates (Moneyness rates"

            " To calculate the cash conversion cycle (net operating cycle), we need to determine three components: the Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), and Days Payables Outstanding (DPO). The cash conversion cycle is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ Cash Conversion Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO \\]\n\nLet's break down how to calculate each component:\n\n1. **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**: This measures the average number of days a company holds its inventory before selling it. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ DIO = \\frac{Average Inventory}{Cost of Goods Sold} \\times 365 \\]\n\n2. **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: This measures the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment after a sale has been made. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ DSO = \\frac{Accounts Receivable}{Credit Sales} \\times 365 \\]\n\n3. **Days Payables Outstanding (DPO)**: This measures the average number of days a company takes to pay its bills and invoices. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ DPO = \\frac{Accounts Payable}{Cost of Goods Sold} \\times 365 \\]\n\nNow, let's use these formulas to write the Python program:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    credit_sales = 40000\n    cost_of_goods_sold = 30000\n    accounts_receivable = 3000\n    inventory_beginning_balance = 1500\n    inventory_ending_balance = 2000\n    accounts_payable = 4000\n    \n    # Calculate average inventory\n    average_inventory = (inventory_beginning_balance + inventory_ending_balance) / 2\n    \n    # Calculate DIO, DSO, and DPO\n    dio = (average_inventory / cost_of_goods_sold) * 365\n    dso = (accounts"

            " Traditionally, investing activities on a cash flow statement include the purchase and sale of long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment, and other assets. The purchase of securities for trading purposes and the proceeds from the sale of trading securities are both related to investing activities. However, the purchase of an affiliate's shares would typically fall under investing activities if it's considered a long-term investment.\n\nIn this case, we are looking at a simplified scenario where we are only given a few items that could be considered as investing activities. The proceeds from the issuance of bonds are financing activities, not investing activities, and therefore should not be considered in the calculation. Here's how you can solve for the net cash flow from investing activities in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables and their values\n    purchase_of_trading_securities = 240\n    proceeds_from_sale_of_trading_securities = -300  # Negative because it's cash inflow\n    purchase_of_affiliate_shares = 275\n\n    # Calculate net cash flow from investing activities\n    net_cash_flow_investing = (purchase_of_trading_securities +\n                               proceeds_from_sale_of_trading_securities +\n                               purchase_of_affiliate_shares)\n\n    # Return the answer in thousands\n    return net_cash_flow_investing\n\n# Call the function to get the net cash flow from investing activities\nnet_investing_cash_flow = solution()\nprint(f\"The net cash flow from investing activities is: ${net_investing_cash_flow} thousands\")\n```\n\nIf you run this program, it will output the net cash flow from investing activities considering the events recorded in 2014."

            " To calculate Business B's operating cash flow for 2017, we need to consider its net income, changes in working capital, and any non-cash expenses or revenues. We will use the indirect method for calculating operating cash flow. However, the provided information includes dividends and an impairment expense, which are not directly used in the calculation of operating cash flow. Instead, we'll focus on the changes in the balance sheet accounts related to operations and the net income information.\n\nGiven that we do not have the net income directly but can infer some information from the retained earnings and dividends, we'll make some assumptions and use that for our calculation. The retained earnings at the end of 2016 are $110 million, and at the end of 2017, they are $125 million. Dividends declared and distributed in 2017 are $8 million.\n\nLet's assume the closing balance of retained earnings is after the dividends have been distributed. Therefore, the net income for 2017 can be calculated as:\n\nNet Income for 2017 = Opening Retained Earnings + Net Income for 2017 - Dividends\n\nBut we need to rearrange it to find Net Income 2017 since we know all other values:\n\nNet Income 2017 = Opening Retained Earnings + Dividends - Closing Retained Earnings\n\nThe changes in working capital will consider changes in Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and Accounts Payable.\n\nThe Python program to calculate operating cash flow for 2017 will look like this:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    retained_earnings_2016 = 110  # in $ millions\n    retained_earnings_2017 = 125  # in $ millions\n    dividends_2017 = 8  # in $ millions\n    accounts_receivable_increase = 48 - 45  # in $ millions\n    inventory_decrease = 24 - 20  # in $ millions\n    accounts_payable_increase = 3"

            " We can approach this problem by first considering the cases for the top performer, then for the second top performer, and finally for the third top performer.

However, based on my previous calculation, it seems I've overcomplicated the solution considering the nature of the question. The correct way to think about it is simpler - it's a permutation problem because each prize is distinct and can go to any of the participants. However, \\( 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\) directly accounts for the permutations of choosing the top 3 without the need for the `perm` function from the `math` library, as it inherently considers permutations. The 'perm' function, while correct in principle, overly complicates this straightforward application. The calculation should indeed be a product of choices for each prize, reflecting the decreasing number of participants for each subsequent prize."

Then we used the formula for the variance of a two-asset portfolio to calculate the portfolio variance. The formula is `var = wX^2 * σX^2 + wY^2 * σY^2 + 2 * wX * wY * σX * σY * corr(X,Y)`, where `w` stands for the weight, `σ` for the standard deviation, and `corr` for the correlation coefficient. Finally, we took the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation of the portfolio."
