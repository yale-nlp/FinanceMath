Since we don't have the Net Income value for the end of 2011, we won't be able to use actual numbers; instead, we'll use placeholders. You would replace the placeholders with the actual values.\n\nHere is the Python program with the necessary placeholders:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    # (These values are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual values)\n    net_income_ending_2011 = 142187  # Placeholder for Net Income at the end of 2011\n    price_to_ffo_ratio_2011 = 11.5   # Placeholder for Price/FFO ratio for the end of 2011 (taken from 2010 since it's not given for 2011)\n    \n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    share_price_ending_2011 = price_to_ffo_ratio_2011 * net_income_ending_2011\n    \n    # return answer\n    return share_price_ending_2011\n\n# You can call the function to get the answer\nprint(solution())\n```\n\nPlease note that the `price_to_ffo_ratio_2011` is eqivalent to 11.5x based on the information provided for the end of 2010. If the ratio for 2011 is different, make sure to use the correct ratio in your calculation."
