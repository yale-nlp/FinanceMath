Johnson and his colleagues predict that, due to a recent reorganization, the firm probably won't distribute dividends for the following three years. However, they anticipate that ABC will start paying an annual dividend of US$1.72 for each share starting from the fourth year onwards. After this, the dividend is predicted to experience a perpetual growth of 4%, though the present price suggests a growth rate of 6% for the identical timeframe. If Johnson's team employs the dividend discount model, what would be the current inherent value of Company ABC stock?",

The loan portfolio is backed by $1.3 billion of consumer deposits and the interest rate is at 5%. Johnson is also predicting that the expected yearly loss on the portfolio is 0.3% of the principal. On top of this, Johnson estimates the unexpected loss on the principal amount could be as high as 8%. Further, Johnson takes into consideration that the risk-free rate is 1.5% and the effective tax rate is 25%. Finally, Johnson presumes there will not be any transfer pricing issues.

After a thorough analysis of the company and its competitors, she is of the opinion that the company will witness exceptional growth for the next 4 years followed by normal growth. Therefore, she concludes that a two-stage DDM is the most suitable for assessing the stock's value. In 2017, the total dividends QX Corp. paid was $0.22. She anticipates a growth rate of 12 percent for the upcoming 4 years and 6 percent thereafter. The required return is projected to be 9 percent.
