The 10% rate of return is represented as discount rate for the future dividends.\n\nIn this case, the first two expected dividends are two separate discounted cash flows but the rest of the cash flows (until infinity as per assumptions of DDM) is a perpetuity growing at a 6% rate that needs to be discounted back to the present.\n\nBased on the above thoughts, the code as follows:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    dividend = 0.5  # THIS IS THE FIRST DIVIDEND PAYOUT\n    growth_rate = 0.06  # THIS IS THE INCREMENTAL GROWTH RATE OF DIVIDENDS\n    rate_of_return = 0.10  # THIS IS THE DISCOUNT RATE\n\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    value_of_dividend_annually = dividend / (rate_of_return - growth_rate)\n    value_of_perpetuity = (dividend * (1 + growth_rate) / (rate_of_return - growth_rate)) / rate_of_return\n    \n    # add these two values to get the overall value\n    value_of_equity = value_of_dividend_annually + value_of_perpetuity\n\n    # return answer\n    return round(value_of_equity, 2)\n```\n\nIn this code, the expected dividend payout (the first dividend) is added to the present value of the perpetuity (growing at the rate of growth rate). After discounting all cash flow to present using a discount rate of return (rate_of_return), the sum of all these discounted cash flows are calculated and returned."

The estimated cost is obtained by multiplying the sum of the trading costs and the holding period in months by the fraction of the annual management fee (obtained by dividing 0.40% by 100) and converting the resulting value to a decimal period for the duration of the holding period. The result is then returned as the answer."

Note that all the returns are compounded continuously. This means that to find the return for a given year, we need to know the interest rate on each compounding period. The formula for the continuously compounded return on an initial investment of P dollars, earning interest at an annual rate r over time t, is given by the equation:\nHPR = e^(rt) - 1. where n is the number of compounding periods.\n\nTherefore, John's HPR for the three years would be:\n\nYear 1: 19.80%\nYear 2: 21.06%\nYear 3: 18.98%\n\nTo find this, we need to calculate the returns and discount them back using the formula above. Let's see how we can do this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    investment_year1 = 500\n    investment_year2 = 600\n    investment_year3 = 1000\n    return_year1 = 0.12\n    return_year2 = 0.05\n    return_year3 = 0.01\n\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    hpr_year1 = (math.e ** (return_year1 * 1.0)) - 1\n    hpr_year2 = (math.e ** (return_year2 * 1.0)) - 1\n    hpr_year3 = (math.e ** (return_year3 * 1.0)) - 1\n\n    # return answer\n    return hpr_year1, hpr_year2, hpr_year3\n```\nThe result will be a tuple with the HPR for each year."

Brian informed the 2 junior analysts that using the earnings from the latest 4 quarters may not accurately reflect cyclical companies' long-term earning potential. Therefore, they may find significantly different P/E ratios even though the company's business outlook remains the same. Brian suggested using normalized EPS to solve this issue. Having gathered information about the company throughout the most recent complete cycle, the 2 junior analysts found that the company's balance sheet reveals total assets worth 2100 million and total liabilities of 1200 million. The value of the preferred equity is $120 million, and there are 32 million common shares outstanding. Given this information, what is the company's normalized EPS?",

        "question": "If ABC Corporation releases three-year bonds dated 1 January 2015 that have a face value of $5,000,000, how are they most likely reported as bonds payable when issued, considering the market interest rate for bonds of similar risk and term is 3% and the bonds yield an annual rate of 2.5% on 31 December?",
        "output": [
            "    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n\n    # return answer\n```\n\nAnalysis:\nBased on the description provided in the question, ABC Corporation has a potential option to report its bonds payable as 5,000,000 when issued. The given information does not explicitly state any discount or premium, hence assumming that the stated discount or premium is zero in this case. That means the bonds are issued at face value.\n\nThe quoted market interest rate for bonds of similar risk and term is 3%, which means the company should be able to raise $5,000,000 by selling these bonds in the open market. However, the bonds are issued at an annual rate of 2.5%, that is, lower than the quoted interest rate in the market.\n\nThis undercutting by ABC Corporation could be due to factors such as investor's perception, company's asset quality and market liquidity, company's brand image, etc. Nonetheless, the bonds would be reported to the creditors as $5,000,000, considering the interest rate used was the market rate and the face value of the bond is par value minus interest.\n\nTherefore, we might define the Python code as:\n\n```python\ndef solution():\n    # Define variables name and value\n    face_value = 5000000\n    market_rate = 0.03\n    issued_rate = 0.025\n    notional_bond_amt = face_value\n\n\n    # Do math calculation to get the answer\n    issue_bonds_income = notional_bond_amt * issued_rate\n    accrued_interest = issue_bonds_income - (notional_bond_amt * market_rate)\n    \n    # return answer\n    return notional_bond_amt, issue_bonds_income, accrued_interest\n```"
